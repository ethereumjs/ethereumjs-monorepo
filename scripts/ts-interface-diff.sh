# Performs a diff between current type definition files and the latest published on npm. 
# This is useful as a helper to detect interface and API changes, without having to look
# at source files or performing git diffs. 
# 
# Note: this script assumes that the d.ts files live under ./dist directory.
# 
# Usage: ./scripts/ts-interface-diff.sh ethereumjs-vm packages/vm/
# Run from repository root
# 
# To send stdout to VS Code to leverage better tools to visualize diff, you can run:
# ./scripts/ts-interface-diff.sh ethereumjs-blockchain packages/blockchain/ | code-

###
# After running this script, you can just run the standalone command:
# git diff --no-index -- .tmp/ethereumjs-vm/A .tmp/ethereumjs-vm/B
# 
# or variations of it:
# git diff --word-diff=color --no-index -- .tmp/ethereumjs-vm/A .tmp/ethereumjs-vm/B
