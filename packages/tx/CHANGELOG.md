## 4.1.0 - 2023-02-21

**DEPRECATED**: Release is deprecated due to broken dependencies, please update to the subsequent bugfix release version.

### Functional Shanghai Support

This release fully supports all EIPs included in the [Shanghai](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs/blob/master/network-upgrades/mainnet-upgrades/shanghai.md) feature hardfork scheduled for early 2023. Note that a `timestamp` to trigger the `Shanghai` fork update is only added for the `sepolia` testnet and not yet for `goerli` or `mainnet`.

You can instantiate a Shanghai-enabled Common instance for your transactions with:

```typescript
import { Common, Chain, Hardfork } from '@ethereumjs/common'

const common = new Common({ chain: Chain.Mainnet, hardfork: Hardfork.Shanghai })
```

### Experimental EIP-4844 Shard Blob Transactions Support

This release supports an experimental version of the blob transaction type introduced with [EIP-4844](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4844) as being specified in the [01d3209](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/commit/01d320998d1d53d95f347b5f43feaf606f230703) EIP version from February 8, 2023 and deployed along `eip4844-devnet-4` (January 2023), see PR [#2349](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2349) as well as PRs [#2522](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2522) and [#2526](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2526).

**Note:** This functionality needs a manual KZG library installation and global initialization, see [KZG Setup](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/tree/master/packages/tx/README.md#kzg-setup) for instructions.

##### Usage

See the following code snipped for an example on how to instantiate.

```typescript
import { Chain, Common, Hardfork } from '@ethereumjs/common'
import { BlobEIP4844Transaction, initKZG } from '@ethereumjs/tx'
import * as kzg from 'c-kzg'

initKZG(kzg, 'path/to/my/trusted_setup.txt')
const common = new Common({ chain: Chain.Mainnet, hardfork: Hardfork.Shanghai, eips: [4844] })

const txData = {
  data: '0x1a8451e600000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000',
  gasLimit: '0x02625a00',
  maxPriorityFeePerGas: '0x01',
  maxFeePerGas: '0xff',
  maxFeePerDataGas: '0xfff',
  nonce: '0x00',
  to: '0xcccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc',
  value: '0x0186a0',
  v: '0x01',
  r: '0xafb6e247b1c490e284053c87ab5f6b59e219d51f743f7a4d83e400782bc7e4b9',
  s: '0x479a268e0e0acd4de3f1e28e4fac2a6b32a4195e8dfa9d19147abe8807aa6f64',
  chainId: '0x01',
  accessList: [],
  type: '0x05',
  versionedHashes: ['0xabc...'], // Test with empty array on a first run
  kzgCommitments: ['0xdef...'], // Test with empty array on a first run
  blobs: ['0xghi...'], // Test with empty array on a first run
}

const tx = BlobEIP4844Transaction.fromTxData(txData, { common })
```

Note that `versionedHashes` and `kzgCommitments` have a real length of 32 bytes and `blobs` have a real length of `4096` bytes and values are trimmed here for brevity.

See the [Blob Transaction Tests](./test/eip4844.spec.ts) for examples of usage in instantiating, serializing, and deserializing these transactions.

## 4.0.2 - 2022-12-09

Maintenance release with dependency updates, PR [#2445](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2445)

## 4.0.1 - 2022-10-18

### Support for Geth genesis.json Genesis Format

For lots of custom chains (for e.g. devnets and testnets), you might come across a [Geth genesis.json config](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interface/private-network) which has both config specification for the chain as well as the genesis state specification.

`Common` now has a new constructor `Common.fromGethGenesis()` - see PRs [#2300](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2300) and [#2319](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2319) - which can be used in following manner to instantiate for example a VM run or a tx with a `genesis.json` based Common:

```typescript
import { Common } from '@ethereumjs/common'
// Load geth genesis json file into lets say `genesisJson` and optional `chain` and `genesisHash`
const common = Common.fromGethGenesis(genesisJson, { chain: 'customChain', genesisHash })
// If you don't have `genesisHash` while initiating common, you can later configure common (for e.g.
// calculating it afterwards by using the `@ethereumjs/blockchain` package)
common.setForkHashes(genesisHash)
```

### New Ethers Static Constructor

There is a new static constructor `TransactionFactory.fromEthersProvider()` which has been added to the library, see PR [#2315](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2315). The new constructor allows for an easy instantiation of a fitting transaction object using an [Ethers](https://ethers.io) provider connecting e.g. to a local node or a service provider like Infura.

### Other Changes and Fixes

- Disallow tx initialization with values incorrectly passed in as arrays, PR [#2284](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2284)

## 4.0.0 - 2022-09-06

Final release - tada 🎉 - of a wider breaking release round on the [EthereumJS monorepo](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo) libraries, see the Beta 1 release notes for the main long change set description as well as the Beta 2, Beta 3 and Release Candidate (RC) 1 release notes for notes on some additional changes ([CHANGELOG](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/blob/master/packages/tx/CHANGELOG.md)).

### Changes

- Internal refactor: removed ambiguous boolean checks within conditional clauses, PR [#2250](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2250)

## 4.0.0-rc.1 - 2022-08-29

Release candidate 1 for the upcoming breaking release round on the [EthereumJS monorepo](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo) libraries, see the Beta 1 release notes for the main long change set description as well as the Beta 2 and 3 release notes for notes on some additional changes ([CHANGELOG](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/blob/master/packages/tx/CHANGELOG.md)).

### Fixed Mainnet Merge HF Default

Since this bug was so severe it gets its own section: `mainnet` in the underlying `@ethereumjs/common` library (`Chain.Mainnet`) was accidentally not updated yet to default to the `merge` HF (`Hardfork.Merge`) by an undiscovered overwrite back to `london`.

This has been fixed in PR [#2206](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2206) and `mainnet` now default to the `merge` as well.

### Maintenance Updates

- Added `engine` field to `package.json` limiting Node versions to v14 or higher, PR [#2164](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2164)
- Replaced `nyc` (code coverage) configurations with `c8` configurations, PR [#2192](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2192)
- Code formats improvements by adding various new linting rules, see Issue [#1935](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/issues/1935)

## 4.0.0-beta.3 - 2022-08-10

Beta 3 release for the upcoming breaking release round on the [EthereumJS monorepo](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo) libraries, see the Beta 1 release notes for the main long change set description as well as the Beta 2 release notes for notes on some additional changes ([CHANGELOG](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/blob/master/packages/tx/CHANGELOG.md)).

### Merge Hardfork Default

Since the Merge HF is getting close we have decided to directly jump on the `Merge` HF (before: `Istanbul`) as default in the underlying `@ethereumjs/common` library and skip the `London` default HF as we initially intended to set (see Beta 1 CHANGELOG), see PR [#2087](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2087).

This means that if this library is instantiated without providing an explicit `Common`, the `Merge` HF will be set as the default hardfork and the behavior of the library changes according to up-to-`Merge` HF rules.

If you want to prevent these kind of implicit HF switches in the future it is likely a good practice to just always do your upper-level library instantiations with a `Common` instance setting an explicit HF, e.g.:

```typescript
import { Common, Chain, Hardfork } from '@ethereumjs/common'

const common = new Common({ chain: Chain.Mainnet, hardfork: Hardfork.London })
const tx = LegacyTransaction.fromTxData(
  {
    // Provide your tx data here or use default values
  },
  { common }
)
```

## 4.0.0-beta.2 - 2022-07-15

Beta 2 release for the upcoming breaking release round on the [EthereumJS monorepo](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo) libraries, see the Beta 1 release notes ([CHANGELOG](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/blob/master/packages/tx/CHANGELOG.md)) for the main change set description.

### Removed Default Exports

The change with the biggest effect on UX since the last Beta 1 releases is for sure that we have removed default exports all accross the monorepo, see PR [#2018](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2018), we even now added a new linting rule that completely disallows using.

Default exports were a common source of error and confusion when using our libraries in a CommonJS context, leading to issues like Issue [#978](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/issues/978).

Now every import is a named import and we think the long term benefits will very much outweigh the one-time hassle of some import adoptions.

#### Common Library Import Updates

Since our [@ethereumjs/common](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/tree/master/packages/common) library is used all accross our libraries for chain and HF instantiation this will likely be the one being the most prevalent regarding the need for some import updates.

So Common import and usage is changing from:

```typescript
import Common, { Chain, Hardfork } from '@ethereumjs/common'

const common = new Common({ chain: Chain.Mainnet, hardfork: Hardfork.Merge })
```

to:

```typescript
import { Common, Chain, Hardfork } from '@ethereumjs/common'

const common = new Common({ chain: Chain.Mainnet, hardfork: Hardfork.Merge })
```

### Removed Default Imports in this Library

While the root import of the tx type classes didn't change you might need to adopt your tx type imports if you have some custom or unusual ways to import (e.g. using deeper-referencing than necessary import paths).

## Other Changes

- Added `ESLint` strict boolean expressions linting rule, PR [#2030](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2030)

## 4.0.0-beta.1 - 2022-06-30

This release is part of a larger breaking release round where all [EthereumJS monorepo](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo) libraries (VM, Tx, Trie, other) get major version upgrades. This round of releases has been prepared for a long time and we are really pleased with and proud of the result, thanks to all team members and contributors who worked so hard and made this possible! 🙂 ❤️

We have gotten rid of a lot of technical debt and inconsistencies and removed unused functionality, renamed methods, improved on the API and on TypeScript typing, to name a few of the more local type of refactoring changes. There are also broader structural changes like a full transition to native JavaScript `BigInt` values as well as various somewhat deep-reaching refactorings, both within a single package as well as some reaching beyond the scope of a single package. Also two completely new packages - `@ethereumjs/evm` (in addition to the existing `@ethereumjs/vm` package) and `@ethereumjs/statemanager` - have been created, leading to a more modular Ethereum JavaScript VM.

We are very much confident that users of the libraries will greatly benefit from the changes being introduced. However - along the upgrade process - these releases require some extra attention and care since the changeset is both so big and deep reaching. We highly recommend to closely read the release notes, we have done our best to create a full picture on the changes with some special emphasis on delicate code and API parts and give some explicit guidance on how to upgrade and where problems might arise!

So, enjoy the releases (this is a first round of Beta releases, with final releases following a couple of weeks after if things go well)! 🎉

The EthereumJS Team

### London Hardfork Default

In this release the underlying `@ethereumjs/common` version is updated to `v3` which sets the default HF to `London` (before: `Istanbul`).

This means that a Transaction object instantiated without providing an explicit `Common` is using `London` as the default hardfork as well and behavior of the library changes according to up-to-`London` HF rules.

If you want to prevent these kind of implicit HF switches in the future it is likely a good practice to just always do your upper-level library instantiations with a `Common` instance setting an explicit HF, e.g.:

```typescript
import Common, { Chain, Hardfork } from '@ethereumjs/common'

const common = new Common({ chain: Chain.Mainnet, hardfork: Hardfork.Merge })
const tx = LegacyTransaction.fromTxData(
  {
    // Provide your tx data here or use default values
  },
  { common }
)
```

### BigInt Introduction / ES2020 Build Target

With this round of breaking releases the whole EthereumJS library stack removes the [BN.js](https://github.com/indutny/bn.js/) library and switches to use native JavaScript [BigInt](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt) values for large-number operations and interactions.

This makes the libraries more secure and robust (no more BN.js v4 vs v5 incompatibilities) and generally comes with substantial performance gains for the large-number-arithmetic-intense parts of the libraries (particularly the VM).

To allow for BigInt support our build target has been updated to [ES2020](https://262.ecma-international.org/11.0/). We feel that some still remaining browser compatibility issues on the edges (old Safari versions e.g.) are justified by the substantial gains this step brings along.

See [#1671](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1671) and [#1771](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1771) for the core `BigInt` transition PRs.

### Disabled esModuleInterop and allowSyntheticDefaultImports TypeScript Compiler Options

The above TypeScript options provide some semantic sugar like allowing to write an import like `import React from "react"` instead of `import * as React from "react"`, see [esModuleInterop](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#esModuleInterop) and [allowSyntheticDefaultImports](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#allowSyntheticDefaultImports) docs for some details.

While this is convenient it deviates from the ESM specification and forces downstream users into these options which might not be desirable, see [this TypeScript Semver docs section](https://www.semver-ts.org/#module-interop) for some more detailed argumentation.

Along the breaking releases we have therefore deactivated both of these options and you might therefore need to adopt some import statements accordingly. Note that you still have got the possibility to activate these options in your bundle and/or transpilation pipeline (but now you also have the option to _not_ do which you didn't have before).

### BigInt-Related API Changes

All transaction data input which have been previously taken in as `BNLike` (see `Util` library) - like `gasPrice` or `nonce` - are now taken in as `BigIntLike` and internally stored as a `BigInt`.

Have a look at your object instantiations on how you do things and if you need to update.

The following method signatures have been changed along the update and need some attention:

- `getBaseFee(): bigint`
- `getDataFee(): bigint`
- `getUpfrontCost(): bigint`

### API Method/Getter Removals

Additionally the following deprecated methods/getters have been removed from the API, see PR [#1742](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1742):

- `get transactionType()`
- `get senderR()` (alias for `r`)
- `get senderS()` (`alias for s`)
- `get yParity()` (`alias for v`)
- `tx.fromRlpSerializedTx()`
- `TransactionFactory.getTransactionClass()`

### Reduced Bundle Size (MB -> KB)

The bundle size of the library has been dramatically reduced going down from MBs to KBs due to a reworked genesis code handling throughout the library stack in PR [#1916](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1916) allowing the `Common` library to now ship without the bundled (large) genesis state definitions (especially for mainnet).

### RLP Changes

If you are dealing with RLP encoded data and use the EthereumJS RLP library for decoding, please note that RLP library also got a major update and has been renamed along the way from `rlp` to a namespaced `@ethereumjs/rlp`, see RLP `v4.0.0-beta.1` (and following) release notes in the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/blob/master/packages/rlp/CHANGELOG.md#400-beta1---2022-06-30).

If you are updating from v2 you will likely also stumble upon the fact that with `v3` RLP replaces Buffers as input and output values in favor of Uint8Arrays for improved performance and greater compatibility with browsers.

New conversion functions have also been added to the `@ethereumjs/util` library, see [RLP docs](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/tree/master/packages/rlp#buffer-compatibility) on how to use and do the conversion.

### Other Changes

- The `hash()` function is now throwing when called on an unsigned legacy tx (this aligns the behavior with the other tx types), PR [#1894](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1894)
- Signature processing code has been updated to use `@ethereumjs/util` `v8`, PR [#1945](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1945)

## 3.5.2 - 2022-06-02

- Fixed a bug where tx options would not propagate from an unsigned to a signed tx when using the `sign()` function (there are not that many tx options, this is therefore in most cases not practically relevant and rather a guard for future option additions), PR [#1884](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1884)
- Stricter `v` value validation for legacy txs, PR [#1905](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1905)

## 3.5.1 - 2022-03-15

### EIP-3860 Support: Limit and Meter Initcode

Support for [EIP-3860](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3860) has been added to the Tx library. This EIP limits the maximum size of initcode to 49152, see PR [#1619](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1619).

Note that this EIP is not part of a specific hardfork yet and is considered `EXPERIMENTAL` (implementation can change along bugfix releases).

For now the EIP has to be activated manually which can be done by using a respective `Common` instance:

```typescript
const common = new Common({ chain: Chain.Mainnet, hardfork: Hardfork.London, eips: [3860] })
```

## 3.5.0 - 2022-02-01

This release comes with various additional checks on integrity and maximally allowed values for input values on tx creation. All these checks are activated by default as being suggested by the respective EIPs (e.g. `EIP-2681`).

- [EIP-2681](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2681) support: Limit account nonce to 2^64-1, PR [#1568](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1568)
- `gasLimit` limited to 2^64-1 (`MAX_UINT64`) (geth behaviour), PR [#1568](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1568)
- No-leading-zeros validation for serialized (RLP based) integer value input, so e.g the `nonce` or `gasLimit` values (`fromSerializedTx()` and `fromValuesArray()` static constructor methods), PR [#1568](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1568)
- `MAX_INTEGER` (2^256) `gasLimit * maxFeePerGas`, `gasLimit * gasPrice` checks, PR [#1568](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1568)
- Tx creation now fails when trying to instantiate with a negative `BN` value, PR [#1606](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1606)

## 3.4.0 - 2021-11-09

### ArrowGlacier HF Support

This release adds support for the upcoming [ArrowGlacier HF](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs/blob/master/network-upgrades/mainnet-upgrades/arrow-glacier.md) (see PR [#1527](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1527)) targeted for December 2021. The only included EIP is [EIP-4345](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4345) which delays the difficulty bomb to June/July 2022.

Please note that for backwards-compatibility reasons the associated Common is still instantiated with `istanbul` by default.

An ArrowGlacier transaction can be instantiated with:

```typescript
import { Transaction } from '@ethereumjs/tx'
import Common, { Chain, Hardfork } from '@ethereumjs/common'

const common = new Common({ chain: Chain.Mainnet, hardfork: Hardfork.ArrowGlacier })
const tx = LegacyTransaction.fromTxData({}, { common })
```

### Additional Error Context for Error Messages

This release extends the text of the error messages in the library with some consistent context information (see PR [#1540](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1540)), here an example for illustration:

Before:

```shell
Invalid Signature: s-values greater than secp256k1n/2 are considered invalid
```

New:

```
Invalid Signature: s-values greater than secp256k1n/2 are considered invalid (tx type=1 hash=0xbf78bd19410294cb3c08fbbbdd675b4bd79e46b96b38e850091f5c03e0571be0 nonce=0 value=0 signed=true hf=london gasPrice=0 accessListCount=0)
```

The extended errors give substantial more object and chain context and should ease debugging.

**Potentially breaking**: Attention! If you do react on errors in your code and do exact errror matching (`error.message === 'invalid transaction trie'`) things will break. Please make sure to do error comparisons with something like `error.message.includes('invalid transaction trie')` instead. This should generally be the pattern used for all error message comparisions and is assured to be future proof on all error messages (we won't change the core text in non-breaking releases).

## Other Changes

- The `dataFee` from `tx.getDataFee()` now gets cached for txs created with the `freeze` option (activated by default), PR [#1532](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1532) and PR [#1550](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1550)

## 3.3.2 - 2021-09-30

This release updates the `ethereumjs-util` library to `v7.1.2` which provides a safer conversion of integer values with the `intToHex` and `intToBuffer` functions by replacing the re-exported functions with own implementations which throw on wrong integer input (decimal values, non-safe integers, negative numbers,...), see PR [#1500](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1500).

An upgrade is recommended since this provides a safer user experience for the tx library by not allowing malformed integer values to be passed in for tx number values (e.g. `gasPrice` or `maxPriorityFeePerGas`) which could lead to undefined behavior before.

## 3.3.1 - 2021-09-24

- The hash from the `tx.hash()` method now gets cached for txs created with the `freeze` option (activated by default), PR [#1445](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1445)
- Fixed `getMessageToSign()` return type for `EIP1559Transaction`, PR [#1382](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1382)

## 3.3.0 - 2021-07-08

### Finalized London HF Support

This release integrates a `Common` library version which provides the `london` HF blocks for all networks including `mainnet` and is therefore the first release with finalized London HF support.

### Improved L2 Tx Support

This tx release bumps the `Common` library dependency version to `v2.4.0` and is therefore assured to work with the reworked `Common.custom()` method which can be used for an easier instantiation of common custom chain instances for sending txs to a custom (L2) network.

`Common.custom()` comes with support for predefined custom chains (Arbitrum testnet, Polygon testnet & mainnet, xDai chain), see e.g. the following code example:

```typescript
import { Transaction } from '@ethereumjs/tx'
import Common from '@ethereumjs/common'

const from = 'PUBLIC_KEY'
const PRIV_KEY = process.argv[2]
const to = 'DESTINATION_ETHEREUM_ADDRESS'

const common = Common.custom(CustomChain.xDaiChain)

const txData = {
  from,
  nonce: 0,
  gasPrice: 1000000000,
  gasLimit: 21000,
  to,
  value: 1,
}

const tx = LegacyTransaction.fromTxData(txData, { common })
const signedTx = tx.sign(Buffer.from(PRIV_KEY, 'hex'))
```

For a non-predefined custom chain it is also possible to just provide a chain ID as well as other parameters to `Common`:

```typescript
const common = Common.custom({ chainId: 1234 })
```

See the tx [README](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/tree/master/packages/tx) for some more detailed documentation on the new improved L2 support for the tx library.

### New supports(capability) Method

There is a new `tx.supports(capability)` method which can be used for a cleaner and more future-proof switch on txs based on the supported (EIP) capabilities. This is useful if you don't know about your tx type in advance, e.g. since txs are taken from a generic source (a tx pool, user input,...) and instantiated with the provided tx factory.

While it sometimes might make sense to do a switch by `tx.type` it is often more fitting a use case (and also more future proof) to do a switch by a desired tx capability. Does the tx support an EIP-1559 style gas fee market mechanism? Does the tx support access lists?

Such a switch can now be done with the method above

```typescript
import { Transaction, Capability } from '@ethereumjs/tx'

// 1. Instantiate tx

// 2. Switch by capability
if (tx.supports(Capability.EIP2930AccessLists)) {
  // Do something which only makes sense for txs with support for access lists
}
```

The following capabilities are currently supported:

```typescript
enum Capabilitiy {
  EIP155ReplayProtection: 155, // Only for legacy txs
  EIP1559FeeMarket: 1559,
  EIP2718TypedTransaction: 2718, // Use for a typed-tx-or-not switch
  EIP2930AccessLists: 2930
}
```

### Included Source Files

Source files from the `src` folder are now included in the distribution build, see PR [#1301](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1301). This allows for a better debugging experience in debug tools like Chrome DevTools by having working source map references to the original sources available for inspection.

## 3.2.1 - 2021-06-11

This release comes with significant library usability improvements by allowing a tx instantiation more independently from the `Common` library. This was reported and requested by Web3.js (thanks to @gregthegreek for giving some guidance on the discussion) and others, since they needed the possibility of a tx instantiation in unknown contexts where the chain or HF state is somewhat unclear.

So we've decided to do the following tweaks to the libray:

### New Rules for Internal Default HF Setting

Up to `v3.2.0` it was simply necessary/mandatory to pass in a `Common` instance for typed tx instantiation (otherwise the instantiation process would have thrown an error). For compatibility reasons the tx library was still on `istanbul` as the default HF and both `EIP-2930` (access lists) and `EIP-1559` (fee market) txs needed a higher (`berlin` respectively `london`) HF setting. After some reflection we have therefore decided to adopt our tx library tx type default HF setting and go with the following expanded rule:

"The default HF is the default HF from `Common` if the tx type is active on that HF. Otherwise it is set to the first greater HF where the tx is active."

This has been done in PR [#1292](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1292). This should be safe to do since there just are no txs of the specific type before this new default HF (`EIP-2930`: `istanbul` -> `berlin`, `EIP-1559`: `istanbul` -> `london`).

### More Intelligent Default Chain Instantiation

We tried to get more intelligent on the instantiation with a default chain if no `Common` is provided. On older versions of the library `mainnet` was the default fallback here. For typed txs the chain ID is also provided as a data parameter along instantiation. This chain ID parameter is now used for the internal `Common` and therefore the internal chain setting. Same for signed EIP-155 respecting legacy txs, there the chain ID is now extracted from the `v` parameter provided and initialized with the internal `Common` accordingly. For unsigned or non-EIP-1559 legacy txs the chain for `Common` still defaults back to `mainnet`.

Both these changes with the new default HF rules and the more intelligent chain ID instantiation now allows for an e.g. `EIP-155` tx instantiation without a Common (and generally for a safer non-Common tx instantiation) like this:

```typescript
import Common from '@ethereumjs/common'
import { FeeMarketEIP1559Transaction } from '@ethereumjs/tx'

const txData = {
  data: '0x1a8451e600000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000',
  gasLimit: '0x02625a00',
  maxPriorityFeePerGas: '0x01',
  maxFeePerGas: '0xff',
  nonce: '0x00',
  to: '0xcccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc',
  value: '0x0186a0',
  v: '0x01',
  r: '0xafb6e247b1c490e284053c87ab5f6b59e219d51f743f7a4d83e400782bc7e4b9',
  s: '0x479a268e0e0acd4de3f1e28e4fac2a6b32a4195e8dfa9d19147abe8807aa6f64',
  chainId: '0x01',
  accessList: [],
  type: '0x02',
}

const tx = FeeMarketEIP1559Transaction.fromTxData(txData)
```

Note that depending on your usage context it might still be a good idea to instantiate with `Common` since you then have a deterministic state setup, explicitly know what rule set your tx is operating on, and are safe towards eventual future behavioral changes (e.g. on a default HF update along a major version tx library bump).

### Signing Txs with a Hardware Wallet

This is just a note on documentation. There has been some confusion around how to use the tx library for signing of a tx with a HW wallet device (e.g. a Ledger) - see Issue [#1228](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/issues/1228) - especially around the usage of `tx.getMessageToSign()`. This is now better documented in the code. Dropping here the associated code on how to do for awareness, for some more context have a look into the associated issue:

```typescript
import { rlp } from 'ethereumjs-util'
import Common from '@ethereumjs/common'
import { Transaction } from '@ethereumjs/tx'

const common = new Common({ chain: 'goerli', hardfork: 'berlin' })
const tx = LegacyTransaction.fromTxData({}, { common })

const message = tx.getMessageToSign(false)
const serializedMessage = rlp.encode(message) // use this for the ledger input
```

### Other Changes

- EIP-1559 Validation (spec update): The `maxFeePerGas` and `maxPriorityFeePerGas` parameters are now limited in size to not exceed 256-bit to prevent chain spamming, PR [#1272](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1272)
- Code docs have been improved substantially, PR [#1283](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1283)
- Deprecation of `tx.transactionType`, use `tx.type` instead, PR [#1283](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1283)
- Deprecation of `tx.yParity`, `tx.senderR` and `tx.senderS`, use `v`, `r` and `s` instead, PR [#1283](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1283)

## 3.2.0 - 2021-05-26

### Functional London HF Support (no finalized HF blocks yet)

This `Tx` release comes with full functional support for the `london` hardfork (all EIPs are finalized and integrated and `london` HF can be activated, there are no final block numbers for the HF integrated though yet). There is a new [EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559) transaction type `FeeMarketEIP1559Transaction` (type `2`) added together with the new data types `FeeMarketEIP1559TxData` (for instantiation with the `fromTxData()` static constructor method) and `FeeMarketEIP1559ValuesArray` (for instantiation with `fromValuesArray()`), see PR [#1148](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1148) for the main implementation work.

An `EIP-1559` tx inherits the access list feature from the `AccessListEIP2930Transaction` (type `1`) but comes with its own gas fee market mechanism. There is no `gasPrice` field in favor of two new gas related properties `maxFeePerGas` - which represents the total gas fee the tx sender is willing to pay for the tx (including the priority fee) - and the `maxPriorityFeePerGas` property - which represents the fee the sender is willing to give as some tip to the miner to prioritize a tx.

An `EIP-1559` tx can be instantiated with:

```typescript
import Common from '@ethereumjs/common'
import { FeeMarketEIP1559Transaction } from '@ethereumjs/tx'

const common = new Common({ chain: 'mainnet', hardfork: 'london' })

const txData = {
  data: '0x1a8451e600000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000',
  gasLimit: '0x02625a00',
  maxPriorityFeePerGas: '0x01',
  maxFeePerGas: '0xff',
  nonce: '0x00',
  to: '0xcccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc',
  value: '0x0186a0',
  v: '0x01',
  r: '0xafb6e247b1c490e284053c87ab5f6b59e219d51f743f7a4d83e400782bc7e4b9',
  s: '0x479a268e0e0acd4de3f1e28e4fac2a6b32a4195e8dfa9d19147abe8807aa6f64',
  chainId: '0x01',
  accessList: [],
  type: '0x02',
}

const tx = FeeMarketEIP1559Transaction.fromTxData(txData, { common })
```

Please note that the default HF is still set to `istanbul`. You therefore need to explicitly set the `hardfork` parameter for instantiating a `Tx` instance with a `london` HF activated.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed `getMessageToSign()` return type for typed txs, PR [#1255](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1255)

### Other Changes

- Deprecated `TransactionFactory.getTransactionClass()` method, PR [#1148](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1148)

## 3.1.4 - 2021-04-22

- Added a new boolean `hashMessage` parameter (defaulting to `true`) to `getMessageToSign()` to allow for returning the raw unsigned `EIP-155` tx and not only the hash, PR [#1188](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/issues/1188)

## 3.1.3 - 2021-04-09

This release fixes a critical EIP-2930 tx constructor bug which slipped through our tests and where a tx is not initialized correctly when a `v` value of `0` is passed (which is a common case for EIP-2930 txs). This makes the typed txs unusable on prior versions and an update from a version `v3.1.0` or higher is necessary for working typed tx support. Releases `v3.1.0`, `v3.1.1` and `v3.1.2` are marked as deprecated.

**Change Summary**

- Fixed `AccessListEIP2930Transaction` constructor bug with `v=0`, PR [#1190](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1190)
- Added alias `type` for `transactionType` so it can be interpreted correctly for an `AccessListEIP2930Transaction` instantiation when passed to `fromTxData()`, PR [#1185](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1185)
- `TransactionFactory.fromTxData()`: fixed a bug where instantiation was breaking when `type` was passed in as a 0x-prefixed hex string, PR [#1185](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1185)
- `AccessListEIP2930Transaction`: added a test that initializes correctly from its own data (adds coverage for `type` property alias), PR [#1185](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1185)
- EIP-2930 aliases for `senderS`, `senderR`, `yParity` are now marked as _deprecated_, use `v`, `r`, `s` instead

## 3.1.2 - 2021-03-31

**DEPRECATED**: Release is deprecated in favor of 3.1.3 which fixes a critical EIP-2930 tx constructor bug.

- Fixed default value for empty access lists in the `AccessListEIP2930Transaction.fromValuesArray()` static constructor method, PR [#1179](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1179)

## 3.1.1 - 2021-03-23

**DEPRECATED**: Release is deprecated in favor of 3.1.3 which fixes a critical EIP-2930 tx constructor bug.

This release fixes a bug in the `v3.1.0` Berlin HF `@ethereumjs/tx` release where the import path for `eip2930Transaction` was broken on operating systems with case sensitive filename resolution.

The `v3.1.0` release has been deprecated in favor of this new version.

## 3.1.0 - 2021-03-18

**DEPRECATED**: Release is deprecated in favor of 3.1.1 which fixes an import-path bug.

### Berlin HF Support

This release comes with full support for the `berlin` hardfork by updating the library to support typed transactions ([EIP-2718](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718)). The first supported transaction type is the `AccessListEIP2930Transaction` ([EIP-2930](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2930)) which adds optional access lists to the mix and is activated along with the `berlin` hardfork.

`EIP-2930` transactions can be instantiated with:

```typescript
import Common from '@ethereumjs/common'
import { AccessListEIP2930Transaction } from '@ethereumjs/tx'

const common = new Common({ chain: 'mainnet', hardfork: 'berlin' })

const txData = {
  data: '0x1a8451e600000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000',
  gasLimit: '0x02625a00',
  gasPrice: '0x01',
  nonce: '0x00',
  to: '0xcccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc',
  value: '0x0186a0',
  v: '0x01',
  r: '0xafb6e247b1c490e284053c87ab5f6b59e219d51f743f7a4d83e400782bc7e4b9',
  s: '0x479a268e0e0acd4de3f1e28e4fac2a6b32a4195e8dfa9d19147abe8807aa6f64',
  chainId: '0x01',
  accessList: [
    {
      address: '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000101',
      storageKeys: [
        '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000',
        '0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000060a7',
      ],
    },
  ],
  type: '0x01',
}

const tx = AccessListEIP2930Transaction.fromTxData(txData, { common })
```

Please note that the default HF is still set to `istanbul`. You therefore need to explicitly set the `hardfork` parameter for instantiating a `Transaction` instance with a `berlin` HF activated.

The now called "legacy" transactions are still supported and can be used as before by using the `Transaction` class. If the type of a tx is only known at runtime there is a new `TransactionFactory` class introduced for your convenience. This factory class decides on the tx type based on the input data and uses the corresponding tx type class for instantiation.

For more guidance on how to use the new tx types and the tx factory have a look at the [README](./README.md) of this library which has received an extensive update along with this release.

#### EthereumJS Libraries - Typed Transactions Readiness

If you are using this library in conjunction with other EthereumJS libraries make sure to minimally have the following library versions installed for typed transaction support:

- `@ethereumjs/common` `v2.2.0`
- `@ethereumjs/tx` `v3.1.0`
- `@ethereumjs/block` `v3.2.0`
- `@ethereumjs/blockchain` `v5.2.0`
- `@ethereumjs/vm` `v5.2.0`

### EIP-2718/EIP-2930 Changes

- Base implementation of both EIPs, PR [#1048](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1048)
- Tx Renaming / Improve backwards-compatibility, PR [#1138](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1138)
- Improvements and additional tests, PR [#1141](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1141)
- Further improvements and small fixes, PR [#1144](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1144)

## 3.0.2 - 2021-02-16

Follow-up release on `v3.0.1` which only partly addressed a **critical** bug. An update is - again - strongly recommended.

- Fixes `tx.isSigned()` always returning true when using the `Tx.fromValuesArray()` static constructor, see PR [#1077](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1077)
- The `Common` instance passed is now copied to avoid side-effects towards the outer common instance on HF updates, PR [#1088](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1088)

## 3.0.1 - 2021-01-20

- Fixes `tx.isSigned()` always returning true - so also for unsigned transactions - due to a bug in the `Transaction` class constructor. This bug is regarded as **critical** and an update is strongly recommended. See PR [#1042](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1042)

## 3.0.0 - 2020-11-24

### New Package Name

**Attention!** This new version is part of a series of EthereumJS releases all moving to a new scoped package name format. In this case the library is renamed as follows:

- `ethereumjs-tx` -> `@ethereumjs/tx`

Please update your library references accordingly or install with:

```shell
npm i @ethereumjs/tx
```

### Major Refactoring - Breaking Changes

This release is a major refactoring of the transaction library to simplify and strengthen its code base. Refactoring work has been done along PR [#812](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/812) and PR [#887](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/887).

#### New Constructor Params

The constructor has been reworked and new static factory methods `fromTxData`, `fromRlpSerializedTx`, and `fromValuesArray` have been added for a more `TypeScript` friendly and less error-prone way to initialize a `Transaction` object. The direct usage of the main constructor (now just being an alias to `Tx.fromTxData()`, see PR [#944](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/944)) is now discouraged and the static factory methods should be used.

**Breaking:** Note that you **need** to adopt your `Transaction` initialization code since the constructor API has changed!

Examples:

```typescript
// Initializing from serialized data
const s1 = tx1.serialize().toString('hex')
const tx = Transaction.fromRlpSerializedTx(toBuffer('0x' + s1))

// Initializing with object
const txData = {
  gasPrice: 1000,
  gasLimit: 10000000,
  value: 42,
}
const tx = LegacyTransaction.fromTxData(txData)

// Initializing from array of 0x-prefixed strings.
// First, convert to array of Buffers.
const arr = txFixture.raw.map(toBuffer)
const tx = Transaction.fromValuesArray(arr)
```

Learn more about the full API in the [docs](./docs/README.md).

#### Immutability

The returned transaction is now frozen and immutable. To work with a maliable transaction, copy it with `const fakeTx = Object.create(tx)`. For security reasons it is highly recommended to stay in a freezed `Transaction` context on usage.

If you need `Transaction` mutability - e.g. because you want to subclass `Transaction` and modifiy its behavior - there is a `freeze` option to prevent the `Object.freeze()` call on initialization, see PR [#941](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/941).

#### from

The `tx.from` alias was removed, please use `const from = tx.getSenderAddress()`.

#### Message to sign

Getting a message to sign has been changed from calling `tx.hash(false)` to `tx.getMessageToSign()`.

#### Fake Transaction

The `FakeTransaction` class was removed since its functionality can now be implemented with less code. To create a fake tansaction for use in e.g. `VM.runTx()` overwrite `getSenderAddress` with your own `Address`. See a full example in the section in the [README](./README.md#fake-transaction).

### New Default Hardfork

**Breaking:** The default HF on the library has been updated from `petersburg` to `istanbul`, see PR [#906](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/906).

The HF setting is now automatically taken from the HF set for `Common.DEAULT_HARDFORK`, see PR [#863](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/863).

### Dual ES5 and ES2017 Builds

We significantly updated our internal tool and CI setup along the work on PR [#913](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/913) with an update to `ESLint` from `TSLint` for code linting and formatting and the introduction of a new build setup.

Packages now target `ES2017` for Node.js builds (the `main` entrypoint from `package.json`) and introduce a separate `ES5` build distributed along using the `browser` directive as an entrypoint, see PR [#921](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/921). This will result in performance benefits for Node.js consumers, see [here](https://github.com/ethereumjs/merkle-patricia-tree/pull/117) for a releated discussion.

- **Breaking:** Reworked constructor to take in data as a `TxData` typed dictionary instead of single values, the `Tx.fromTxData()` factory method becomes an alias for the constructor with this change, see PR [#944](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/944)

## 3.0.0-beta.1 - 2020-10-22

### New Package Name

**Attention!** This new version is part of a series of EthereumJS releases all moving to a new scoped package name format. In this case the library is renamed as follows:

- `ethereumjs-tx` -> `@ethereumjs/tx`

Please update your library references accordingly or install with:

```shell
npm i @ethereumjs/tx
```

### Major Refactoring - Breaking Changes

This release is a major refactoring of the transaction library to simplify and strengthen its code base. Refactoring work has been done along PR [#812](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/812) and PR [#887](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/887).

#### New Constructor Params

The constructor used to accept a varying amount of options but now has the following shape:

```typescript
  Transaction(
    nonce: BN,
    gasPrice: BN,
    gasLimit: BN,
    to: Address | undefined,
    value: BN,
    data: Buffer,
    v?: BN,
    r?: BN,
    s?: BN,
    opts?: TxOptions
  )
```

Initializing from other data types is assisted with new static factory helpers `fromTxData`, `fromRlpSerializedTx`, and `fromValuesArray`.

Examples:

```typescript
// Initializing from serialized data
const s1 = tx1.serialize().toString('hex')
const tx = Transaction.fromRlpSerializedTx(toBuffer('0x' + s1))

// Initializing with object
const txData = {
  gasPrice: 1000,
  gasLimit: 10000000,
  value: 42,
}
const tx = LegacyTransaction.fromTxData(txData)

// Initializing from array of 0x-prefixed strings.
// First, convert to array of Buffers.
const arr = txFixture.raw.map(toBuffer)
const tx = Transaction.fromValuesArray(arr)
```

#### Immutability

The returned transaction is now frozen and immutable. To work with a maliable transaction, copy it with `const fakeTx = Object.create(tx)`.

#### from

The `tx.from` alias was removed, please use `const from = tx.getSenderAddress()`.

#### Message to sign

Getting a message to sign has been changed from calling `tx.hash(false)` to `tx.getMessageToSign()`.

#### Fake Transaction

The `FakeTransaction` class was removed since its functionality can now be implemented with less code. To create a fake tansaction for use in e.g. `VM.runTx()` overwrite `getSenderAddress` with your own `Address`. See a full example in the section in the [README](./README.md#fake-transaction).

### New Default Hardfork

**Breaking:** The default HF on the library has been updated from `petersburg` to `istanbul`, see PR [#906](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/906).
The HF setting is now automatically taken from the HF set for `Common.DEAULT_HARDFORK`,
see PR [#863](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/863).

### Dual ES5 and ES2017 Builds

We significantly updated our internal tool and CI setup along the work on
PR [#913](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/913) with an update to `ESLint` from `TSLint`
for code linting and formatting and the introduction of a new build setup.

Packages now target `ES2017` for Node.js builds (the `main` entrypoint from `package.json`) and introduce
a separate `ES5` build distributed along using the `browser` directive as an entrypoint, see
PR [#921](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/921). This will result
in performance benefits for Node.js consumers, see [here](https://github.com/ethereumjs/merkle-patricia-tree/pull/117) for a releated discussion.

## [2.1.0] - 2019-06-28

**Using testnets and custom/private networks is now easier**

This release is focused on making this library easier to use in chains other than `mainnet`.

Using standard testnets can be as easy as passing their names to the `Transaction` constructor. For
example, `new Transaction(rawTx, {chain: 'ropsten', hardfork: 'byzantium'})` is enough to use this
library with Ropsten on Byzantium.

If you are using a custom network, you can take advantage of [ethereumjs-common](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-common),
which contains all the network parameters. In this version of `ethereumjs-tx` you can use its new
`Common.forCustomNetwork` to create a `Common` instance based on a standard network with some
parameters changed. You can see an example of how to do this [here](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-common/blob/9e624f86107cea904d8171524130d92c99bf9302/src/index.ts).

List of changes:

- Upgraded [ethereumjs-common](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-common) to `^1.3.0`
- Added more documentation and examples on how to create transactions for public testnets and
  custom networks.

[2.1.0]: https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/compare/%40ethereumjs%2Ftx%402.0.0...%40ethereumjs%2Ftx%402.1.0

## [2.0.0] - 2019-06-03

**TypeScript / Module Import / Node Support**

First `TypeScript` based release of the library, see
PR [#145](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-tx/pull/145) for details.

This comes along with some changes on the API, Node import of the exposed
classes now goes like this:

```javascript
const EthereumTx = require('ethereumjs-transaction').Transaction
const FakeEthereumTx = require('ethereumjs-transaction').FakeTransaction
```

The library now also comes with a **type declaration file** distributed along
with the package published.

Along with this release we drop official support for `Node` versions `4`,`5`
and `6`. Officially tested versions are now `Node` `8`, `10` and `11`
(see PRs [#138](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-tx/pull/138) and
[#146](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-tx/pull/146)).

**Hardfork Support / Official Test Updates**

Along with a long overdue update of the official Ethereum Transaction tests
(see PRs [#131](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-tx/pull/131) and
[#138](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-tx/pull/138) for
`FakeTransaction`) and
an introduction of setting chain and hardfork by using our shared
[ethereumjs-common](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-common) class
(see PR [#131](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-tx/pull/130)) the
transaction library now supports all HFs up to the `Petersburg` hardfork,
see [constructor option docs](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-tx/blob/master/docs/interfaces/transactionoptions.md) for information on instantiation and default values (current hardfork default: `petersburg`).

API Changes:

- Removal of the `data.chainId` parameter, use the `opts.chain` parameter or a custom `Common` instance

**Default EIP-155 Support**

Along with defaulting to a post-`Spurious Dragon` HF replay protection from
[EIP-155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-155) is now activated by default. Transactions are subsequently also by default signed with `EIP-155` replay protection,
see PRs [#153](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-tx/pull/153),
[#147](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-tx/pull/147) and
[#143](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-tx/pull/143).

This comes with some changes in how different `v` values passed on instantation
or changed on runtime are handled:

- The constructor throws if the `v` value is present, indicates that `EIP-155`
  was enabled, and the chain id it indicates doesn't match the one of the
  internal `common` object
- No default `v` is set. If a transaction isn't signed, it would be an empty
  buffer
- If `v` is changed after construction its value is validated in its setter

For activating non-`EIP-155` behavior instantiate the transaction with a
pre-`Spurious Dragon` hardfork option.
