[Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## 10.0.0-dev-rc.1 - 2025-03-24

This is the first (and likely the last) round of `RC` releases for the upcoming breaking releases, following the `alpha` releases from October 2024 (see `alpha` release release notes for full/main change description). The releases are somewhat delayed (sorry for that), but final releases can now be expected very very soon, to be released once the Ethereum [Pectra](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7600) hardfork is scheduled for mainnet and all EIPs are fully finalized. Pectra will then also be the default hardfork setting for all EthereumJS libraries.

### New Versioning Scheme

This breaking release round will come with a new versioning scheme (thanks to paulmillr for the [suggestion](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/issues/3748)), aligning the package numbers on breaking releases for all EthereumJS packages. This will make it easier to report bugs ("bug happened on EthereumJS version 10 releases"), reason about release series and make library compatibility more transparent and easier to grasp.

As a start we bump all major release versions to version 10, these `RC` releases are the first to be released with the new versioning scheme.

**Note: while we also bump the verkle package version for consistency reasons please be aware that this package is still in an experimental stage and not yet production ready!**

### EthereumJS-wide Error Objects

We have done preparations to allow for handling specific error sub types in the future by introducing a monorepo-wide `EthereumJSError` error class in the `@ethereumjs/util` package, see PR [#3879](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/3879). This error is thrown for all error cases within the monorepo and can be specifically handled by comparing with `instanceof EthereumJSError`.

We will introduce a set of more specific sub error classes inheriting from this generic type in upcoming minor releases, and so keeping things fully backwards compatible. This will allow for a more specific and robust handling of errors thrown by EthereumJS libraries.
