| Implements schema and functions related to Ethereum's block. |
| --- |

Note: this `README` reflects the state of the library from `v3.0.0` onwards. See `README` from the [standalone repository](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-block) for an introduction on the last preceeding release.

# INSTALL

`npm install @ethereumjs/block`

# USAGE

There are three static factories to instantiate a `Block`:

- `Block.fromBlockData(blockData: BlockData = {}, opts?: BlockOptions)`
- `Block.fromRLPSerializedBlock(serialized: Buffer, opts?: BlockOptions)`
- `Block.fromValuesArray(values: BlockBuffer, opts?: BlockOptions)`

For `BlockHeader` instantiation analogue factory methods exists, see API docs linked below.

Instantiation Example:

```typescript
import { BlockHeader } from '@ethereumjs/block'

const headerData = {
  number: 15,
  parentHash: '0x6bfee7294bf44572b7266358e627f3c35105e1c3851f3de09e6d646f955725a7',
  difficulty: 131072,
  gasLimit: 8000000,
  timestamp: 1562422144,
}
const header = BlockHeader.fromHeaderData(headerData)
```

Properties of a `Block` or `BlockHeader` object are frozen with `Object.freeze()` which gives you enhanced security and consistency properties when working with the instantiated object. This behavior can be modified using the `freeze` option in the constructor if needed.

API Usage Example:

```typescript
try {
  await block.validate(blockchain)
  // Block validation has passed
} catch (err) {
  // handle errors appropriately
}
```

[Documentation](./docs/README.md)

# CONSENSUS TYPES

The block library supports the creation as well as format and consensus validation of PoW `ethash` and PoA `clique` blocks.

## Ethash/PoW

An Ethash/PoW block can be instantiated as follows:

```typescript
import { Block } from '@ethereumjs/block'
import Common from '@ethereumjs/common'
const common = new Common({ chain: 'mainnet' })
console.log(common.consensusType()) // 'pow'
console.log(common.consensusAlgorithm()) // 'ethash'
const block = Block.fromBlockData({}, { common })
```

To validate that the difficulty of the block matches the canonical difficulty use `block.validate(blockchain)`.

To calculate the difficulty when creating the block pass in the block option `calcDifficultyFromHeader` with the preceding (parent) `BlockHeader`.

## Clique/PoA (since v3.1.0)

A clique block can be instantiated as follows:

```typescript
import { Block } from '@ethereumjs/block'
import Common from '@ethereumjs/common'
const common = new Common({ chain: 'goerli' })
console.log(common.consensusType()) // 'poa'
console.log(common.consensusAlgorithm()) // 'clique'
const block = Block.fromBlockData({}, { common })
```

For clique PoA `BlockHeader.validate()` function validates the various Clique/PoA-specific properties (`extraData` checks and others, see API documentation) and `BlockHeader.validateConsensus()` can be used to properly validate that a Clique/PoA block has the correct signature.

For sealing a block on instantiation you can use the `cliqueSigner` constructor option:

```typescript
const cliqueSigner = Buffer.from('PRIVATE_KEY_HEX_STRING', 'hex')
const block = Block.fromHeaderData(headerData, { cliqueSigner })
```

Additionally there are the following utility methods for Clique/PoA related functionality in the `BlockHeader` class:

- `BlockHeader.validateCliqueDifficulty(blockchain: Blockchain): boolean`
- `BlockHeader.cliqueSigHash()`
- `BlockHeader.cliqueIsEpochTransition(): boolean`
- `BlockHeader.cliqueExtraVanity(): Buffer`
- `BlockHeader.cliqueExtraSeal(): Buffer`
- `BlockHeader.cliqueEpochTransitionSigners(): Address[]`
- `BlockHeader.cliqueVerifySignature(signerList: Address[]): boolean`
- `BlockHeader.cliqueSigner(): Address`

See the API docs for detailed documentation. Note that these methods will throw if called in a non-Clique/PoA context.

# TESTING

Tests in the `tests` directory are partly outdated and testing is primarily done by running the `BlockchainTests` from within the [@ethereumjs/vm](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/tree/master/packages/vm) package.

To avoid bloating this repository with [ethereum/tests](https://github.com/ethereum/tests) JSON files, we usually copy specific JSON files and wrap them with some metadata (source, date, commit hash). There's a helper to aid in that process and can be found at [wrap-ethereum-test.sh](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/blob/master/packages/block/scripts/wrap-ethereum-test.sh).
