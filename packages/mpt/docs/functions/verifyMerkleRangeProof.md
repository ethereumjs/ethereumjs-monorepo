# Function: verifyMerkleRangeProof()

> **verifyMerkleRangeProof**(`rootHash`, `firstKeyRaw`, `lastKeyRaw`, `keysRaw`, `values`, `proof`, `useKeyHashingFunction`): `Promise`\<`boolean`\>

Defined in: [packages/mpt/src/proof/range.ts:420](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/blob/master/packages/mpt/src/proof/range.ts#L420)

Checks whether the given leaf nodes and edge proof can prove the given trie leaves range is matched with the specific root.

A range proof is a proof that includes the encoded trie nodes from the root node to leaf node for one or more branches of a trie,
allowing an entire range of leaf nodes to be validated. This is useful in applications such as snap sync where contiguous ranges
of state trie data is received and validated for constructing world state, locally.

There are four situations:

- All elements proof. In this case the proof can be null, but the range should
  be all the leaves in the trie.

- One element proof. In this case no matter the edge proof is a non-existent
  proof or not, we can always verify the correctness of the proof.

- Zero element proof. In this case a single non-existent proof is enough to prove.
  Besides, if there are still some other leaves available on the right side, then
  an error will be returned.

- Two edge elements proof. In this case two existent or non-existent proof(first and last) should be provided.

NOTE: Currently only supports verification when the length of firstKey and lastKey are the same.

## Parameters

### rootHash

`Uint8Array`

root hash of state trie this proof is being verified against.

### firstKeyRaw

`null` | `Uint8Array`\<`ArrayBufferLike`\>

### lastKeyRaw

`null` | `Uint8Array`\<`ArrayBufferLike`\>

### keysRaw

`Uint8Array`\<`ArrayBufferLike`\>[]

### values

`Uint8Array`\<`ArrayBufferLike`\>[]

value list of leaf data being proven, one-to-one correspondence with keys.

### proof

proof node list, if all-elements-proof where no proof is needed, proof should be null, and both `firstKey` and `lastKey` must be null as well

`null` | `Uint8Array`\<`ArrayBufferLike`\>[]

### useKeyHashingFunction

[`HashKeysFunction`](../type-aliases/HashKeysFunction.md) = `keccak256`

## Returns

`Promise`\<`boolean`\>

a flag to indicate whether there exists more trie node in the trie
