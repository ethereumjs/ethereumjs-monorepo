| Implementation of Binary Trees as specified in [EIP-7864](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7864) |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

> Binary Trees are a novel cryptographic data structure proposed for use in Ethereum to optimize state storage and proof verification. Unlike Merkle Patricia Tries, Binary Trees use a strict binary branching structure, allowing smaller proof sizes. By reducing storage overhead and improving proof efficiency, Binary Trees aim to enhance Ethereumâ€™s scalability while maintaining robust security guarantees.

This package is currently in early alpha and is a work in progress. It is not intended for use in production environments, but rather for research and development purposes. Any help in improving the package is very much welcome.
