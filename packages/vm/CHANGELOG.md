## 6.4.0 - 2023-01-16

**DEPRECATED**: Release is deprecated due to broken dependencies, please update to the subsequent bugfix release version.

### Functional Shanghai Support

This release fully supports all EIPs included in the [Shanghai](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs/blob/master/network-upgrades/mainnet-upgrades/shanghai.md) feature hardfork scheduled for early 2023. Note that a `timestamp` to trigger the `Shanghai` fork update is only added for the `sepolia` testnet and not yet for `goerli` or `mainnet`.

You can instantiate a Shanghai-enabled Common instance for your transactions with:

```typescript
import { Common, Chain, Hardfork } from '@ethereumjs/common'

const common = new Common({ chain: Chain.Mainnet, hardfork: Hardfork.Shanghai })
```

Note: that this is only a finalizing release by e.g. integrating an updated `@ethereumjs/common` library with an updated Shanghai HF setting and all Shanghai related EIP functionality has been already released in former releases. Do a fulltext search on the EIP numbers in the EVM/VM CHANGELOG files for additional information and usage instructions.

### Experimental EIP-4844 Shard Blob Transactions Support

This release supports an experimental version of the blob transaction type introduced with [EIP-4844](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4844) as being specified in the [01d3209](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/commit/01d320998d1d53d95f347b5f43feaf606f230703) EIP version from February 8, 2023 and deployed along `eip4844-devnet-4` (January 2023), see PR [#2349](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2349) as well as PRs [#2522](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2522) and [#2526](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2526).

#### Initialization

To run VM/EVM related EIP-4844 functionality you have to active the EIP in the associated `@ethereumjs/common` library:

```typescript
import { Common, Chain, Hardfork } from '@ethereumjs/common'

const common = new Common({ chain: Chain.Mainnet, hardfork: Hardfork.Shanghai, eips: [4844] })
```

EIP-4844 comes with a new opcode `DATAHASH` and adds a new point evaluation precompile at address `0x14` in the underlying `@ethereumjs/evm` package.

**Note:** Usage of the point evaluation precompile needs a manual KZG library installation and global initialization, see [KZG Setup](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/tree/master/packages/tx/README.md#kzg-setup) for instructions.

#### Shard Blob Transactions and Block Building

The VM is now capable of running blob-including txs and blocks with `VM.runTx()` and `VM.runBlock()` taking the new gas costs for blob transactions into account. The underlying EVM `v1.3.0` now supports the new `DATAHASH` opcode and the new point evaluation precompile.

The Block Builder API (see [README](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/tree/master/packages/vm)) has been expanded to now also allow for building blocks including shard blob transactions and calculate the correct values for data gas usage.

### Other Changes

- Added `minerValue` as a getter to the `BlockBuilder` and a result value for `RunTxResult`, PR [#2457](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2457)
- New option `skipHardforkValidation` for `VM.runTx()` and `VM.runBlock()`, PR [#2486](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2486)
- **Breaking** (for experimental feature): Changes withdrawal amount representation from WEI to GWEI, see PR [#2483](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2483)
- More flexible logic to execute pre-/post Merge txs with `VM.runTx()` when exact HF is not known, see PR [#2505](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2505)
- VM/EEI copy fixes, PR [#2529](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2529)
- Block builder related logic updates in `VM.buildBlock()` and `VM.runTx()`, PR [#2533](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2533)

## 6.3.0 - 2022-12-09

### Experimental EIP-4895 Beacon Chain Withdrawals Support

This release comes with experimental [EIP-4895](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4895) beacon chain withdrawals support, see PR [#2353](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2353) for the plain implementation and PR [#2401](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2401) for updated calls for the CL/EL engine API. Also note that there is a new helper module in [@ethereumjs/util](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/tree/master/packages/util) with a new dedicated `Withdrawal` class together with additional TypeScript types to ease withdrawal handling.

Withdrawals support can be activated by initializing a respective `Common` object, see [@ethereumjs/block](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/tree/master/packages/block) library README for an example on how to instantiate a withdrawals block:

```typescript
import { Common, Chain } from '@ethereumjs/common'
const common = new Common({ chain: Chain.Mainnet, eips: [4895] })
```

In the VM withdrawals blocks can now both be executed with `VM.runBlock()` and build with `VM.buildBlock()` (for a more complex example you can have a look at the EIP tests in `test/api/EIPs/eip-4895-withdrawals.spec.ts`).

### Hardfork-By-Time Support

The VM library is now ready to work with hardforks triggered by timestamp, which will first be applied along the `Shanghai` HF, see PR [#2437](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2437). This is achieved by integrating a new timestamp supporting `@ethereumjs/common` library version.

### Bug Fixes and Other Changes

- More correctly timed `nonce` updates in `VM.runTx()` to avoid certain consensus-critical `nonce`/`account` update constallations. PR [#2404](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2404)

A reminder: This package does not contain the core EVM code any more. For EVM related bugfixes see the associated [@ethereumjs/evm](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/tree/master/packages/evm) `v1.2.3` release.

## 6.2.0 - 2022-10-21

This release replaces the `v6.1.0` release from a couple of days ago which now becomes deprecated. The async event emitter library switch from the `async-eventemitter` package to the `eventemitter2` package turned out to be breaking along parts of the functionality.

This release therefore switches back to a modernized version of the `async-eventemitter` package - now also solving previous import problems - which has been internalized and integrated into the `@ethereumjs/util` package, see PR [#2376](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2376).

## 6.1.0 - 2022-10-18

[ DEPRECATED ]: Async event emitter library switch turned out to be breaking. If you have got problems, please update to v6.2.0 or above.

### Support for Geth genesis.json Genesis Format

For lots of custom chains (for e.g. devnets and testnets), you might come across a [Geth genesis.json config](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interface/private-network) which has both config specification for the chain as well as the genesis state specification.

`Common` now has a new constructor `Common.fromGethGenesis()` - see PRs [#2300](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2300) and [#2319](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2319) - which can be used in following manner to instantiate for example a VM run or a tx with a `genesis.json` based Common:

```typescript
import { Common } from '@ethereumjs/common'
// Load geth genesis json file into lets say `genesisJson` and optional `chain` and `genesisHash`
const common = Common.fromGethGenesis(genesisJson, { chain: 'customChain', genesisHash })
// If you don't have `genesisHash` while initiating common, you can later configure common (for e.g.
// calculating it afterwards by using the `@ethereumjs/blockchain` package)
common.setForkHashes(genesisHash)
```

### New Async Event Emitter: async-eventemitter -> eventemitter2

Along some deeper investigation of build errors related to the usage of the `async-eventemitter` package we finally decided to completely switch to a new async event emitter package for VM/EVM events, see PR [#2303](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2303). The old [async-eventemitter](https://github.com/ahultgren/async-eventemitter) package hasn't been updated for several years and the new [eventemitter2](https://github.com/EventEmitter2/EventEmitter2) package is more modern and maintained as well as substantially more used and therefore a future-proof choice for an async event emitter library to build the VM/EVM event emitting system upon.

The significant parts of the API of both the old and the new libraries are the same and the switch shouldn't cause too much hassle for people upgrading. In case you nevertheless stumble upon upgrading problems regarding the event emitter package switch please feel free to open an issue, we'll be there to assist you on the upgrade!

### Other Changes and Fixes

- Migrated from `rbtree` to [js-sdsl](https://github.com/js-sdsl/js-sdsl) package for caching functionality (maintained, better performance), PR [#2285](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2285)
- Added [retesteth](https://github.com/ethereum/retesteth) support for transition-tool protocol, PR [#2088](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2088)

## 6.0.0 - 2022-09-06

Final release - tada 🎉 - of a wider breaking release round on the [EthereumJS monorepo](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo) libraries, see the Beta 1 release notes for the main long change set description as well as the Beta 2, Beta 3 and Release Candidate (RC) 1 release notes for notes on some additional changes ([CHANGELOG](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/blob/master/packages/vm/CHANGELOG.md)).

### Changes

- **Breaking:** Renamed `receiptRoot` parameter to `receiptsRoot` (plural for `receipts`) for `VM.runBlock()` result and `AfterBlock` event, PR [#2259](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2259)
- Internal refactor: removed ambiguous boolean checks within conditional clauses, PR [#2248](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2248)

## 6.0.0-rc.1 - 2022-08-29

Release candidate 1 for the upcoming breaking release round on the [EthereumJS monorepo](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo) libraries, see the Beta 1 release notes for the main long change set description as well as the Beta 2 and 3 release notes for notes on some additional changes ([CHANGELOG](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/blob/master/packages/evm/CHANGELOG.md)).

### Fixed Mainnet Merge HF Default

Since this bug was so severe it gets its own section: `mainnet` in the underlying `@ethereumjs/common` library (`Chain.Mainnet`) was accidentally not updated yet to default to the `merge` HF (`Hardfork.Merge`) by an undiscovered overwrite back to `london`.

This has been fixed in PR [#2206](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2206) and `mainnet` now default to the `merge` as well.

### Removed AsyncEventEmitter / New events Property

This is the biggest VM change in this release. The inheritance structure of both the VM and the underlying EVM has been reworked and the `VM` and `EVM` classes have been freed from being a child class of `AsyncEventEmitter` and inheriting all its properties and methods in favor of a new `events` property cleanly separating all events logic from the core `VM`/`EVM`, see PR [#2235](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2235).

This allows for an easier typing of the inner `EVM` and makes the core VM/EVM classes leaner and not overloaded with various other partly unused properties. The new `events` property is optional.

Usage code of events needs to be slighly adopted and updated from:

```typescript
vm.on('beforeBlock', (val) => {
  // Do something
}
vm.evm.on('step', (e) => {
  // Do something
}
```

To:

```typescript
vm.events.on('beforeBlock', (val) => {
  // Do something
}
vm.evm.events!.on('step', (e) => {
  // Do something
}
```

### Other Changes

- Made `touchAccount` of `VMState` public, PR [#2183](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2183)
- **Pontentially breaking:** Removed `common` option from underlying `StateManager`, PR [#2197](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2197)
- Reworked/adjusted underlying EVM `skipBalance` option semantics, PR [#2138](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2138)
- Fixed an underlying EVM event signature typing bug, PR [#2184](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2184)

### Maintenance Updates

- Added `engine` field to `package.json` limiting Node versions to v14 or higher, PR [#2164](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2164)
- Replaced `nyc` (code coverage) configurations with `c8` configurations, PR [#2192](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2192)
- Code formats improvements by adding various new linting rules, see Issue [#1935](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/issues/1935)

## 6.0.0-beta.3 - 2022-08-10

Beta 3 release for the upcoming breaking release round on the [EthereumJS monorepo](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo) libraries, see the Beta 1 release notes for the main long change set description as well as the Beta 2 release notes for notes on some additional changes ([CHANGELOG](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/blob/master/packages/vm/CHANGELOG.md)).

### Merge Hardfork Default

Since the Merge HF is getting close we have decided to directly jump on the `Merge` HF (before: `Istanbul`) as default in the underlying `@ethereumjs/common` library and skip the `London` default HF as we initially intended to set (see Beta 1 CHANGELOG), see PR [#2087](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2087).

This means that if this library is instantiated without providing an explicit `Common`, the `Merge` HF will be set as the default hardfork and the behavior of the library changes according to up-to-`Merge` HF rules.

If you want to prevent these kind of implicit HF switches in the future it is likely a good practice to just always do your upper-level library instantiations with a `Common` instance setting an explicit HF, e.g.:

```typescript
import { Common, Chain, Hardfork } from '@ethereumjs/common'

const common = new Common({ chain: Chain.Mainnet, hardfork: Hardfork.London })
```

### Easier Blockchain Customization

The VM now aligns with the updated `Blockchain` interface from PR [#2069](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2069) and now takes in any blockchain implementations adhering to the interface for the `blockchain` option. This makes it easier to do customization on the Blockchain class or pass in an alternative implementation.

## Other Changes

- **Breaking:** Renamed `hardforkByTD` option for the constructor and `VM.runBlock()` to `hardforkByTTD`, PR [#2075](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2075)
- Fixed a bug in the underlying EVM when nonce is 0, PR [#2054](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2054)
- EVM/VM instantiation fixes, PR [#2078](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2078)
- Moved `@types/async-eventemitter` from devDependencies to dependencies, PR [#2077](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2077)
- Added additional exports for the underlying EVM `EvmErrorMessage`, `ExecResult`, `InterpreterStep`, `Message`, PR [#2063](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2063)

## 6.0.0-beta.2 - 2022-07-15

Beta 2 release for the upcoming breaking release round on the [EthereumJS monorepo](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo) libraries, see the Beta 1 release notes ([CHANGELOG](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/blob/master/packages/vm/CHANGELOG.md)) for the main change set description.

### Removed Default Exports

The change with the biggest effect on UX since the last Beta 1 releases is for sure that we have removed default exports all accross the monorepo, see PR [#2018](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2018), we even now added a new linting rule that completely disallows using.

Default exports were a common source of error and confusion when using our libraries in a CommonJS context, leading to issues like Issue [#978](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/issues/978).

Now every import is a named import and we think the long term benefits will very much outweigh the one-time hassle of some import adoptions.

#### Common Library Import Updates

Since our [@ethereumjs/common](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/tree/master/packages/common) library is used all accross our libraries for chain and HF instantiation this will likely be the one being the most prevalent regarding the need for some import updates.

So Common import and usage is changing from:

```typescript
import Common, { Chain, Hardfork } from '@ethereumjs/common'

const common = new Common({ chain: Chain.Mainnet, hardfork: Hardfork.Merge })
```

to:

```typescript
import { Common, Chain, Hardfork } from '@ethereumjs/common'

const common = new Common({ chain: Chain.Mainnet, hardfork: Hardfork.Merge })
```

### Removed Default Imports in this Library

The main `VM` class import has been updated, so import changes from:

```typescript
import VM from '@ethereumjs/vm'
```

to:

```typescript
import { VM } from '@ethereumjs/vm'
```

## Other Changes

- Added `ESLint` strict boolean expressions linting rule, PR [#2030](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2030)

## 6.0.0-beta.1 - 2022-06-30

This release is part of a larger breaking release round where all [EthereumJS monorepo](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo) libraries (VM, Tx, Trie, other) get major version upgrades. This round of releases has been prepared for a long time and we are really pleased with and proud of the result, thanks to all team members and contributors who worked so hard and made this possible! 🙂 ❤️

We have gotten rid of a lot of technical debt and inconsistencies and removed unused functionality, renamed methods, improved on the API and on TypeScript typing, to name a few of the more local type of refactoring changes. There are also broader structural changes like a full transition to native JavaScript `BigInt` values as well as various somewhat deep-reaching refactorings, both within a single package as well as some reaching beyond the scope of a single package. Also two completely new packages - `@ethereumjs/evm` (in addition to the existing `@ethereumjs/vm` package) and `@ethereumjs/statemanager` - have been created, leading to a more modular Ethereum JavaScript VM.

We are very much confident that users of the libraries will greatly benefit from the changes being introduced. However - along the upgrade process - these releases require some extra attention and care since the changeset is both so big and deep reaching. We highly recommend to closely read the release notes, we have done our best to create a full picture on the changes with some special emphasis on delicate code and API parts and give some explicit guidance on how to upgrade and where problems might arise!

So, enjoy the releases (this is a first round of Beta releases, with final releases following a couple of weeks after if things go well)! 🎉

The EthereumJS Team

### EVM and StateManager Extraction

This breaking release round comes with some broader changes to the VM package. The code base has been substantially modularized and two new packages, `@ethereumjs/evm` and `@ethereumjs/statemanager` have been created, also see the CHANGELOGs from both new packages for additional guidance.

The EVM package extracts the inner core, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) respectively the bytecode engine, see PRs [#1892](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1892), [#1955](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1955) and [#1977](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1977) for the main implementation work and PR [#1974](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1974) for the package extraction work.

The StateManager extracts the high-level state access interface, see PR [#1817](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1817). Both can now directly be passed in to the `VM` package along instantiation or are otherwise instantiated as default versions with default values being set.

The EVM related options now moved over to the EVM package directly, namely:

- `allowUnlimitedContractSize`
- `customOpcodes`
- `customPrecompiles`

Both the `runCall()` and `runCode()` API methods also moved over to the `evm` package and are now called through the contained EVM:

- `vm.evm.runCall()`
- `vm.evm.runCode()`

The VM provides an implementation for the `EEI` interface from the `EVM` package which can be used by the EVM to request environmental data for bytecode processing. It is now also possible to provide a custom EEI by a corresponding constructor option.

### London Hardfork Default

In this release the underlying `@ethereumjs/common` version is updated to `v3` which sets the default HF to `London` (before: `Istanbul`).

This means that a Block object instantiated without providing an explicit `Common` is using `London` as the default hardfork as well and behavior of the library changes according to up-to-`London` HF rules.

If you want to prevent these kind of implicit HF switches in the future it is likely a good practice to just always do your upper-level library instantiations with a `Common` instance setting an explicit HF, e.g.:

```typescript
import Common, { Chain, Hardfork } from '@ethereumjs/common'

const common = new Common({ chain: Chain.Mainnet, hardfork: Hardfork.Merge })
```

### BigInt Introduction / ES2020 Build Target

With this round of breaking releases the whole EthereumJS library stack removes the [BN.js](https://github.com/indutny/bn.js/) library and switches to use native JavaScript [BigInt](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt) values for large-number operations and interactions.

This makes the libraries more secure and robust (no more BN.js v4 vs v5 incompatibilities) and generally comes with substantial performance gains for the large-number-arithmetic-intense parts of the libraries (particularly the VM).

To allow for BigInt support our build target has been updated to [ES2020](https://262.ecma-international.org/11.0/). We feel that some still remaining browser compatibility issues on the edges (old Safari versions e.g.) are justified by the substantial gains this step brings along.

See [#1671](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1671) and [#1771](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1771) for the core `BigInt` transition PRs.

### EVM BigInt Support

The whole EVM has been rewritten to use BigInt which has been a huge undertaking. Both all internal representation for values previously represented as BN.js instances (gas values, stack, opcode parameters,...) as well as all VM arithmetics have been rewritten to use native BigInts.

This comes with a substantial increase in overall EVM performance, we will provide some numbers on this later on! 🙂

### EIP-3074 Authcall Support

The EVM now comes with experimental support for [EIP-3074](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3074) introducing two new opcodes `Auth` and `Authcall` to allow externally owned accounts to delegate control to a contract, see PRs [#1788](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1788) and [#1867](<[#1788](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1788)>).

### Disabled esModuleInterop and allowSyntheticDefaultImports TypeScript Compiler Options

The above TypeScript options provide some semantic sugar like allowing to write an import like `import React from "react"` instead of `import * as React from "react"`, see [esModuleInterop](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#esModuleInterop) and [allowSyntheticDefaultImports](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#allowSyntheticDefaultImports) docs for some details.

While this is convenient, it deviates from the ESM specification and forces downstream users into using these options, which might not be desirable, see [this TypeScript Semver docs section](https://www.semver-ts.org/#module-interop) for some more detailed argumentation.

Along with the breaking releases we have therefore deactivated both of these options and you might therefore need to adapt some import statements accordingly. Note that you still can activate these options in your bundle and/or transpilation pipeline (but now you also have the option _not_ to, which you didn't have before).

### Folder Restructure

The VM code base has been somewhat reorganized, see PR [#1991](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1991). The `VM` class moved to a dedicated `vm.ts` file, all exported types moved to `types.ts`. The `index.ts` file now serves as a central place for re-exports so that all accessible functionality and classes like `Bloom` or `EEI` are now accessible without the need of a deeper `dist` folder reference.

### Deprecation Tasks

The following deprecation tasks have been processed in PR [#1815](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1815):

- Remove deprecated `state` (Trie) constructor option
- Remove deprecated `generateTxReceipt` function in `runBlock()` (preferring newer version located in runTx)
- Remove Receipt re-exports
- Removed deprecated `EIP2930Receipt` and `EIP1559Receipt` types
- `gasUsed` deduplication
- Difference between `gasUsed` and `execResult.gasUsed` #1446 (comment)
- Moved `EVMResult.gasUsed` to `RunTxResult` where it is added to there, and `execResult.gasUsed` remains the same
- `runCode()` throws if `gasLimit` is undefined: the `gasLimit` parameter is mandatory
- Move `gasRefund` to a tx-level result object instead of `ExecResult`

### Other Changes

- The `vm.runBlockchain()` API method has been removed, PR [#1916](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1916)
- Improved `skipBalance` logic, PR [#1849](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1849)

## 5.9.0 - 2022-04-14

### EIP-3651: Warm COINBASE (Shanghai CFI EIP)

Small EIP - see [EIP-3651](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3651) considered for inclusion (CFI) in Shanghai to address an initially overpriced `COINBASE` access, PR [#1814](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1814).

EIP can be activated manually with:

```typescript
const common = new Common({ chain: Chain.Mainnet, hardfork: Hardfork.London, eips: [3651] })
```

### EIP-1153: Transient Storage Opcodes

Experimental implementation of [EIP-1153](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1153), see PR [#1768](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1768), thanks to [Mark Tyneway](https://github.com/tynes) from Optimism for the implementation! ❤️

The EIP adds opcodes for manipulating state that behaves identically to storage but is discarded after every transaction. This makes communication via storage (`SLOAD`/`SSTORE`) more efficient and would allow for significant gas cost reductions for various use cases.

Hardfork inclusion of the EIP was extensively discussed during [ACD 135, April 1 2022](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/500).

EIP can be activated manually with:

```typescript
const common = new Common({ chain: Chain.Mainnet, hardfork: Hardfork.London, eips: [1153] })
```

### Custom Precompiles (L2 Support)

It is now possible to add, override or delete precompiles in the VM with a new `customPrecompiles` option, see PR [#1813](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1813). This allows for further customization of VM behavior in addition to the recently added `customOpcodes` option, which can be useful for L2 solutions, EVM-based side chains, and other L1s.

An EVM initialization with a custom precompile looks roughly like this where you can provide the intended precompile `address` and some precompile `function` which needs to adhere to some specific format to be internally readable and executable:

```typescript
const vm = await VM.create({
  customPrecompiles: [
    {
      address: shaAddress,
      function: customPrecompile,
    },
  ],
})
```

### Other Changes

- Updated `ethereum/tests` to `10.3`, PR [#1826](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1826)
- Set `caller` in `VM.runCall()` to zero address if not provided, PR [#1840](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1840)

## 5.8.0 - 2022-03-15

### Merge Kiln v2 Testnet Support

This release fully supports the Merge [Kiln](https://kiln.themerge.dev/) testnet `v2` complying with the latest Merge [specs](https://hackmd.io/@n0ble/kiln-spec). The release is part of an [@ethereumjs/client](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/tree/master/packages/client) `v0.4` release which can be used to sync with the testnet, combining with a suited consensus client (e.g. the Lodestar client). See [Kiln](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/tree/master/packages/client/kiln) instructions to get things going! 🚀

In the VM the `merge` HF is now activated as being supported and an (experimental) Merge-ready VM can be instantiated with:

```typescript
import VM from '@ethereumjs/vm'
import Common, { Chain, Hardfork } from '@ethereumjs/common'

const common = new Common({ chain: Chain.Mainnet, hardfork: Hardfork.Merge })
const vm = new VM({ common })
vm._common.isActivatedEIP(4399) // true
```

- [EIP-4399](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4399) Support: Supplant DIFFICULTY opcode with PREVRANDAO, PR [#1565](https://
  github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1565)

### EIP-3540: EVM Object Format (EOF) v1 / EIP-3670: EOF - Code Validation

This release supports [EIP-3540](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3540) and [EIP-3670](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3670) in an experimental state. Both EIPs together define a container format EOF for the VM in v1 which allows for more flexible EVM updates in the future and allows for improved EVM bytecode validation, see PR [#1719](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1719).

Note that this EIP is not part of a specific hardfork yet and is considered `EXPERIMENTAL` (implementation can change along bugfix releases).

For now the EIP has to be activated manually which can be done by using a respective `Common` instance:

```typescript
const common = new Common({ chain: Chain.Mainnet, hardfork: Hardfork.London, eips: [3540, 3670] })
```

### EIP-3860 Support: Limit and Meter Initcode

Support for [EIP-3860](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3860) has been added to the VM. This EIP limits the maximum size of initcode to 49152 and apply extra gas cost of 2 for every 32-byte chunk of initcode, see PR [#1619](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1619).

Also here, implementation still `EXPERIMENTAL` and needs to be manually activated:

```typescript
const common = new Common({ chain: Chain.Mainnet, hardfork: Hardfork.London, eips: [3860] })
```

### L2 Support: Genesis State with Code and Storage

It is now possible within the VM to initialize with an extended genesis state not only containing account balances but also code and storage, see PR [#1757](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1757). This is part of our emerging L2 support strategy to allow for a VM instantiation that closer resembles a specific L2 (or generally: custom chain) setup. Many L2 chains come with specific system contracts pre-initialized on genesis - see e.g. [Optimism](https://community.optimism.io/docs/protocol/protocol-2.0/#system-overview).

See `Common` [custom chain initialization API](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/tree/master/packages/common#initialize-using-customchains-array) on how to initialize a `Common` instance with a code-storage-containing custom genesis state.

Note that state in the VM is not activated by default (this also goes for account-only state). A state activation can now be explicitly triggered though by using the new `activateGenesisState` VM option.

### L2 Support: Custom Opcodes Option

There is now a new option `customOpcodes` for the VM which allows to add custom opcodes to the VM, see PR [#1705](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1705). This should be useful for L2s and other EVM based side chains if they come with a slighly different opcode set for bytecode execution.

New opcodes can be passed in with its own logic function and an additional function for gas calculation. Additionally the new option allows for overwriting and/or deleting existing opcodes.

### Features

- Added new `VM.runBlock()` option `hardforkByTD` for Merge transition support, PR [#1802](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1802)

### Bug Fixes & Maintenance

- Fixed `REVERT` bug where under certain conditions (revert reason larger than max code size), too much (all) gas was consumed, PR [#1700](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1700)
- Debug log improvements on `VM.runTx()` execution and in `EVM`, PR [#1677](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1677)

## 5.7.1 - 2022-02-04

This patch release adds a guard to not enable the recently added EIP-3607 by default. This helps downstream users who may emulate contract accounts as part of their testing strategies.

- Add guard to not enable EIP-3607 by default, PR [#1691](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1691)

Also included is a performance enhancement to skip extra log processing when debug is not enabled:

- Skip `_runStepHook` method if no step event listener, PRs [#1676](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1676) [#1681](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1681)

## 5.7.0 - 2022-02-01

### Dynamic Gas Costs

Jochem from our team did a great refactoring how the VM handles gas costs in PR [#1364](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1364) by splitting up the opcode gas cost calculation (new file: `evm/opcodes/gas.ts`) from their actual behavior (stack edits, getting block hashes, etc.).

This initial work was adopted a bit in PR [#1553](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1553) to remain backwards-compatible and now allows to output the dynamic gas cost value in the VM `step` event (see `README`) now taking things like memory usage, address access or storage changes into account and therefore much better reflecting the real gas usage than only showing the (much lower) static part.

So along with the static `opcode.fee` output there is now a new event object property `opcode.dynamicFee`.

### StateManager Refactoring

The VM `StateManager` has been substantially refactored in PR [#1548](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1548) and most of the generic functionality has been extracted to a super class `BaseStateManager`. This should make it substantially easier to do custom `StateManager` implementations with an alternative access to the state by inheriting from `BaseStateManager` and only adopting the methods which directly access the underlying data structure. Have a look at the existing `DefaultStateManager` implementation for some guidance.

### Other Features

- New `ProofStateManager` to get an [EIP-1186](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1186)-compatible (respectively `eth_getProof rPC endpoint-compatible) proof for a specific address and associated storage slots, PR [#1590](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1590) and PR [#1660](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1660)
- VM JumpDest analysis refactor for better performance, PR [#1629](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1629)
- [EIP-3607](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3607): Reject transactions from senders with deployed code, PR [#1568](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1568)
- Support for new [Sepolia](https://sepolia.ethdevops.io/) PoW test network (use `Chain.Sepolia` for `@ethereumjs/common` instance passed in), PR [#1581](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1581)
- [EIP-2681](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2681): Limit account nonce to 2^64-1, PR [#1608](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1608)
- [EIP-3855](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3855): Push0 opcode, PR [#1616](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1616)

### Bug Fixes & Maintenance

- Addressed consensus issue: tx goes OOG but refunds get applied anyways (thanks @LogvinovLeon for reporting! ❤️), PR [#1603](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1603)
- VM now throws when a negative `Call` `value` is passed in, PR [#1606](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1606)

## 5.6.0 - 2021-11-09

### ArrowGlacier HF Support

This release adds support for the upcoming [ArrowGlacier HF](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs/blob/master/network-upgrades/mainnet-upgrades/arrow-glacier.md) (see PR [#1527](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1527)) targeted for December 2021. The only included EIP is [EIP-4345](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4345) which delays the difficulty bomb to June/July 2022.

Please note that for backwards-compatibility reasons the associated Common is still instantiated with `istanbul` by default.

An ArrowGlacier VM can be instantiated with:

```typescript
import VM from '@ethereumjs/vm'
import Common, { Chain, Hardfork } from '@ethereumjs/common'

const common = new Common({ chain: Chain.Mainnet, hardfork: Hardfork.ArrowGlacier })
const vm = new VM({ common })
```

### Additional Error Context for Error Messages

This release extends the text of the error messages in the library with some consistent context information (see PR [#1540](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1540)), here an example for illustration:

Before:

```shell
invalid receiptTrie
```

New:

```
invalid receiptTrie (vm hf=berlin -> block number=1 hash=0x8e368301586b53e30c58dd4734de4b3d6e17db837eb3fbde8cc0036bc7752d9a hf=berlin baseFeePerGas=none txs=1 uncles=0)
```

The extended errors give substantial more object and chain context and should ease debugging.

**Potentially breaking**: Attention! If you do react on errors in your code and do exact errror matching (`error.message === 'invalid transaction trie'`) things will break. Please make sure to do error comparisons with something like `error.message.includes('invalid transaction trie')` instead. This should generally be the pattern used for all error message comparisions and is assured to be future proof on all error messages (we won't change the core text in non-breaking releases).

### Other Changes

- Fixed accountExists bug in pre-Spurious Dragon HFs, PR [#1516](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1516) and PR [#1524](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1524)
- New `putBlockIntoBlockchain` option for `BlockBuilder` (default: `true`), PR [#1530](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1530)
- Extended `StateManager.generateGenesis()` to also allow for creating genesis blocks with contract accounts, PR [#1530](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1530) and PR [#1541](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1541)
- Use `RLP` library exposed by `ethereumjs-util` dependency (deduplication), PR [#1549](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1549)

## 5.5.3 - 2021-09-24

- Fixed a consensus-relevant bug in the Blake2B precompile (see [EIP-152](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-152)) with messages with a length >= 5 (thanks @jochem-brouwer for the great analysis and quick fix on this! ❤️), PR [#1486](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1486)
- Improved support for custom chain genesis states in `StateManager.generateCanonicalGenesis()` (see `Common` v2.5.0 release for the corresponding functionality), PR [#1409](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1409)
- Fixed `VM.copy()` to also copy the `blockchain` and `common` objects, PR [#1444](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1444)

And, also worth to note: we are not susceptible to the IDENTITY precompile bug which caused a minority fork in August 2021, see PR [#1436](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1436) and - again - thanks @jochem-brouwer for the quick analysis! 😃

## 5.5.0 - 2021-07-08

### Finalized London HF Support

This release integrates a `Common` library version which provides the `london` HF blocks for all networks including `mainnet` and is therefore the first release with finalized London HF support.

### Included Source Files

Source files from the `src` folder are now included in the distribution build, see PR [#1301](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1301). This allows for a better debugging experience in debug tools like Chrome DevTools by having working source map references to the original sources available for inspection.

### Other Changes & Fixes

- Improved browser compatibility by replacing `instanceof` calls on tx objects with functionality checks, PR [#1315](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1315)

## 5.4.2 - 2021-07-06

- BlockBuilder: allow customizable baseFeePerGas, PR [#1326](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1326)

## 5.4.1 - 2021-06-11

This release comes with some additional `EIP-1559` checks and functionality:

- Additional 1559 check in `VM.runTx()` that the tx sender balance must be >= gas_limit \* max_fee_per_gas, PR [#1272](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1272)
- Additional 1559 check in `VM.runTx()` to ensure that the user was willing to at least pay the base fee (`transaction.max_fee_per_gas >= block.base_fee_per_gas`), PR [#1276](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1276)
- 1559 support for the BlockBuilder (`VM.buildBlock()`) by setting the new block's `baseFeePerGas` to `parentBlock.header.calcNextBaseFee()`, PR [#1280](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1280)

## 5.4.0 - 2021-05-26

### Functional London HF Support (no finalized HF blocks yet)

This `VM` release comes with full functional support for the `london` hardfork (all EIPs are finalized and integrated and `london` HF can be activated, there are no final block numbers for the HF integrated though yet). Please note that the default HF is still set to `istanbul`. You therefore need to explicitly set the `hardfork` parameter for instantiating a `VM` with the `london` HF activated:

```typescript
import VM from '@ethereumjs/vm'
import Common from '@ethereumjs/common'
const common = new Common({ chain: 'mainnet', hardfork: 'london' })
const vm = new VM({ common })
```

Support for the following EIPs has been added:

- [EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559): Fee market change for ETH 1.0 chain, PR [#1148](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1148)
- [EIP-3198](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3198): BASEFEE opcode, PR [#1148](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1148)
- [EIP-3529](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3529): Reduction in refunds, PR [#1239](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1239)
- [EIP-3541](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3541): Reject new contracts starting with the 0xEF byte, PR [#1240](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1240)

It is also possible to run these EIPs in isolation by instantiating a `berlin` common and activate selected EIPs with the `eips` option:

```typescript
const common = new Common({ chain: 'mainnet', hardfork: 'berlin', eips: [3529] })
```

#### EIP-1559: Gas Fee Market

The VM can now run `EIP-1559` compatible blocks (introduced with the `@ethereumjs/block` `v3.3.0` release) with `VM.runBlock()` as well as `EIP-1559` txs with type `2` (introduced along the `@ethereumjs/tx` `v3.2.0` release), which can now be passed to `VM.runTx()` as the tx to be executed. Block and tx validation is happening accordingly and the gas calculation takes the new gas fee market parameters from the block (`baseFeePerGas`) and the tx(s) (`maxFeePerGas` and `maxPriorityFeePerGas` instead of a `gasPrice`) into account.

#### EIP-3198: BASEFEE Opcode

There is a new opcode `BASEFEE` added to the VM, see PR [#1148](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1148). This opcode is active starting with `london` and returns the base fee of the current executed upon block.

#### EIP-3529: Reduction in Refunds

`EIP-3529` removes gas refunds for `SELFDESTRUCT`, and reduces gas refunds for `SSTORE`, an implementation has been done in PR [#1239](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1239).

#### EIP-3541: Reject new Contracts with the 0xEF Byte

There is a new EVM Object Format (EOF) in preparation which will allow to validate contracts at deploy time. This EIP is a preparation for the introduction of this format and disallows contracts which start with the `0xEF` byte. Contracts created in the VM via create transaction, `CREATE` or `CREATE2` starting with this byte are now rejected when the EIP is activated and an `INVALID_BYTECODE_RESULT` is returned as an EVM error with the result, see PR [#1240](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1240).

### StateManager: Preserve State History

This VM release bumps the `merkle-patricia-tree` dependeny to `v4.2.0`, which is used as a datastore for the default `StateManager` implementation. The new MPT version switches to a default behavior to not delete any trie nodes on checkpoint commits, which has implications on the `StateManager.commit()` function which internally calls the MPT commit. This allows to go back to older trie states by setting a new (old) state root with `StateManager.setStateRoot()`. The trie state is now guaranteed to still be consistent and complete, which has not been the case before and lead to erraneous behaviour in certain usage scenarios (e.g. reported by HardHat).

See PR [#1262](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1262)

### Error Handling: Correct Non-VM Error Propagation

In former versions of the VM non-VM errors happing inside the VM have been (unintentionally) shielded by a `try / catch` clause in the VM `Interpreter` class. This lead to existing bugs being hidden and channeled through as VM errors, which made it extremely difficult to trace such bugs down to the root cause. These kind of errors are now properly propagated and therefore lead to a break of the VM control flow. Please note that this might lead to your code breaking _if_ you have got an error in your implementation (this should be a good this though since now this bug can finally be fixed 😀 ).

See PR [#1168](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1168)

### Bug Fixes

- StateManager: fixed buffer comparison in `setStateRoot()`, PR [#1212](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1212)

### Other Changes

- New `blockGasUsed` option for `VM.runTx()` allowing to provide the block gas used up until the tx to be executed to obtain an accurate tx receipt, PR [#1264](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1264)
- `StateManager.getStateRoot()` is not throwing any more on uncommitted checkpoints, PR [#1216](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1216)

## 5.3.2 - 2021-04-12

This is a hot-fix performance release, removing the `debug` functionality from PR [#1080](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1080) and follow-up PRs. While highly useful for debugging, this feature side-introduced a siginficant reduction in VM performance which went along unnoticed. For now we will remove since upstream dependencies are awaiting a new release before the `Belin` HF happening. We will try to re-introduce in a performance friendly manner in some subsequent release (we cannot promise on that though).

See PR [#1198](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1198).

## 5.3.1 - 2021-04-09

**Features**

- Added `receipt` to `RunTxResult`, moved the tx receipt generation logic from `VM.runBlock()` to `VM.runTx()` (`generateTxReceipt()` and receipt exports in `runBlock` are now marked as _deprecated_), PR [#1185](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1185)

**Bug Fixes**

- Fixed BlockBuilder (see `v5.3.0` release) to allow building a block with zero txs, PR [#1185](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1185)
- BlockBuilder: Moves the `stateManager.commit` to after putting the block in blockchain in case it throws on validating, PR [#1185](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1185)

**Testing**

- Added test cases for legacy and access list transactions to `VM.runBlock()` tests, PR [#1185](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1185)
- Added type safety test (thanks to @alcuadrado from Hardhat for this code magic piece ❤️), PR [#1185](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1185)

## 5.3.0 - 2021-03-31

### EIP-2930 Tx Access List Generation

This release adds the ability to generate access lists from tx runs with `VM.runTx()`, see PR [#1170](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1170). There is a new option `reportAccessList` which can be used on all tx types to generate an access list as defined by [EIP-2930](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2930) which is then returned along the `VM.runTx()` result adhering to the `@ethereumjs/tx` `AccessList` TypeScript type definition.

Note that this functionality needs the new `StateManager.generateAccessList()` function which is not yet part of the `StateManager` interface for compatibility reasons. If you implement an own `StateManager` make sure that this function is present (e.g. by inheriting your `StateManager` from the `DefaultStateManager` implementation).

Another note: there is an edge case on accessList generation where an internal call might revert without an accessList but pass if the accessList is used for a tx run (so the subsequent behavior might change). This edge case is not covered by this implementation.

### New Block Builder

There is a new Block Builder API for creating new blocks on top of the current state by adding transactions one at a time, see PR [#1158](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1158).

It can be used like the following:

```typescript
const blockBuilder = await vm.buildBlock({ parentBlock, blockData, blockOpts })
const txResult = await blockBuilder.addTransaction(tx)
// reset the state with `blockBuilder.revert()`
const block = await blockBuilder.build()
```

When the block is built it becomes fully executed in the vm and its blockchain.

### Other Changes

- Fixed `VM.runBlock()` with `generate: true` by setting the header fields for `gasUsed`, `logsBloom`, `receiptTrie`, and `transactionsTrie`, PR [#1158](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1158)
- Fixed a bug in `VM.runTx()` with `reportAccessList=true`returning addresses without a `0x` prefix, PR [#1183](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1183)
- Do not include the tx sender address in the access list in `VM.runTx()` with `reportAccessList=true`, only include the `to` address if storage slots have been touched, PR [#1183](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1183)

## 5.2.0 - 2021-03-18

### Berlin HF Support

This release is the first VM release with official `berlin` HF support. All `EthereumJS` dependencies are updated with `berlin` enabling versions and support for all EIPs which finally made it into `berlin` has been added, namely:

- [EIP-2565](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2565): ModExp gas cost
- [EIP-2718](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718): Typed transactions
- [EIP-2929](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2929): Gas cost increases for state access opcodes
- [EIP-2930](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2930): Optional Access Lists Typed Transactions

Please note that the default HF is still set to `istanbul`. You therefore need to explicitly set the `hardfork` parameter for instantiating a `VM` instance with a `berlin` HF activated:

```typescript
import VM from '@ethereumjs/vm'
import Common from '@ethereumjs/common'
const common = new Common({ chain: 'mainnet', hardfork: 'berlin' })
const vm = new VM({ common })
```

There is a relatively broad set of changes since the last VM version `v5.1.0` introducing support for a first set of to-be-expected `berlin` EIPs, here is a summary:

#### Added Typed Transaction Support (EIP-2718 / EIP-2930)

The VM is now prepared to work with Typed Transactions ([EIP2718](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718)) which have been introduced along the `@ethereumjs/tx` `v3.1.0` release. It now therefore gets possible to pass typed txs to `VM.runTx()` respectively a block containing typed txs to `VM.runBlock()`, see PR [#1048](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1048) and PR [#1138](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1138).

There is a first concrete tx type 1 including optional access lists added along the `berlin` HF ([EIP2930](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2930)). Access lists are now properly detected by the VM and gas costs calculated accordingly.

#### Fixed EIP-2929 Implementation

Our implementation of `EIP-2929` (gas cost increases for state access opcodes) was falling short in the form that warm storage slots / addresses were only tracked per internal message, not on the entire transaction as implied by the EIP. This needed a relatively intense rework along PR [#1124](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1124). We are now confident in the implementation and official tests are passing.

Along with this rework a new `StateManager` interface `EIP2929StateManager` has been introduced which inherits from `StateManager` and adds the following methods:

```typescript
export interface EIP2929StateManager extends StateManager {
  addWarmedAddress(address: Buffer): void
  isWarmedAddress(address: Buffer): boolean
  addWarmedStorage(address: Buffer, slot: Buffer): void
  isWarmedStorage(address: Buffer, slot: Buffer): boolean
  clearWarmedAccounts(): void
}
```

The `StateManager` base interface and the inherited `EIP2929StateManager` interface will be merged again on the next breaking release.

#### Removed EIP-2315 from Berlin

`EIP-2315` has been removed from the list of EIPs included in `berlin`. This is ensured by using a `Common` dependency version `v2.2.0`+ containing the final list of `Berlin` EIPs and also needed some changes in the VM code, see PR [#1142](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1142).

#### EthereumJS Libraries - Typed Transactions Readiness

If you are using this library in conjunction with other EthereumJS libraries make sure to minimally have the following library versions installed for typed transaction support:

- `@ethereumjs/common` `v2.2.0`
- `@ethereumjs/tx` `v3.1.0`
- `@ethereumjs/block` `v3.2.0`
- `@ethereumjs/blockchain` `v5.2.0`
- `@ethereumjs/vm` `v5.2.0`

### Other Features

- `{ stateRoot, gasUsed, logsBloom, receiptRoot }` have been added to `RunBlockResult` and will be emitted with `afterBlock`, PR [#853](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/853)
- Added `vm:eei:gas` EEI gas debug looger, PR [#1124](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1124)

### Other Fixes

- Fixes VM Node 10 support being broken due to the usage of `globalThis` for browser detection, PR [#1151](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1151)
- Fixed `ECRECOVER` precompile to work correctly on networks with very large chain IDs, PR [#1139](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1139)

**CI and Test Improvements**

### 5.1.0 - 2021-02-22

### Clique/PoA Support

This release introduces Clique/PoA support, see the main PR [#1032](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1032) as well as the follow-up PRs [#1074](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1074) and PR [#1088](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1088). This means that you now can run a VM with blocks or transactions from the main PoA networks `Goerli` and `Rinkeby` and generally can use the VM in a Clique/PoA context.

Here is a simple example:

```typescript
import VM from '@ethereumjs/vm'
import Common from '@ethereumjs/common'

const common = new Common({ chain: 'goerli' })
const hardforkByBlockNumber = true
const vm = new VM({ common, hardforkByBlockNumber })

const serialized = Buffer.from('f901f7a06bfee7294bf4457...', 'hex')
const block = Block.fromRLPSerializedBlock(serialized, { hardforkByBlockNumber })
const result = await vm.runBlock(block)
```

All the corresponding internal dependencies have been updated to Clique/PoA supporting versions, namely:

- @ethereumjs/block -> `v3.1.0`
- @ethereumjs/blockchain -> `v5.1.0`
- @ethereumjs/common" -> `v2.1.0`

Note that you need to also use library versions equal or higher than the ones mentioned above when you pass in an instance from one of the libraries to an API call (e.g. `VM.runBlock()`, see example above) to ensure everything is working properly in a Clique/PoA context.

New VM behavior in a Clique/PoA context:

- `VM.runBlock()`: If you do block validation along block runs blocks are now validated to comply with the various Clique/PoA block format specifications (various `extraData` checks e.g.)
- `VM.runBlock()`: There is no assignment of block rewards to the `coinbase` account taking place
- `VM.runTx()`: Tx fees are attributed to the block signer instead of the `coinbase` account
- `COINBASE` opcode: The `COINBASE` opcode returns the block signer instead of the `coinbase` address (Clique specification)

### StateManager Checkpointing Performance

This is the first release which reliably exposes performance gains on all checkpointing operations by integrating the respective `merkle-patricia-trie` [v4.1.0](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/releases/tag/merkle-patricia-tree%404.1.0) where the checkpointing mechanism has been reworked substantially.

This leads to linearly growing performance gains on all checkpointing operations (in `VM.runBlock()`, `VM.runTx()` as well as along all `message` calls) along with the size of the trie (state) being operated upon. In practice we have seen 10-50x increases when working on blocks from `mainnet` or the other test networks.

We would be happy on some feedback if this integration is noticeable in your execution context! 😀

### New EIPs

#### EIP-2565: ModExp precompile gas cost

This release adds support for [EIP 2565](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2565), ModExp precompile gas cost, which is planned to be included in the Berlin hardfork, see PR [#1026](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1026).

#### VM Debug Logger

The VM now comes with an integrated debug logger which gives you fine-grained control to display selected log output along the VM execution flow, see PR [#1080](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1080). These loggers use the [debug](https://github.com/visionmedia/debug) library and can be activated on the CL with `DEBUG=[Logger Selection] node [Your Script to Run].js` and produce output like the following:

![EthereumJS VM Debug Logger](./debug.png?raw=true)

For an overview on the different loggers available see the respective [README section](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/tree/master/packages/vm#understanding-the-vm).

### Other Features

- The `afterBlock` (`VM.runBlock()`) and `afterTx` (`VM.runTx()`) events now expose the respective block or transaction in the event results, PR [#965](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/965)
- New `hardforkByBlockNumber` VM constructor option for `VM.runBlock()` runs (see also corresponding `Block` option), PR [#966](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/966) and [#967](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/967) (option renamed along release PR)
- Added new optional `maxBlocks` option to `VM.runBlockchain()`, PR [#1025](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1025)
- `VM.runBlockchain()` now returns the number of actual blocks run (needs `Blockchain` `v5.1.0` or higher, `void` kept in `TypeScript` function signature for backwards-compatibility), PR [#1065](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1065)
- New option `skipBlockGasLimitValidation` to disable the block gas limit check in `VM.runTx()`, PR [#1039](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1039)
- Added type definition `Log` for logs in `TxReceipt` items returned (result of `VM.runBlocks()` and `afterBlock` event), PR [#1084](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1084)

### Bug Fixes

- **Consensus**: fixed `Frontier` consensus bug along `CREATE` with not enough gas, PR [#1081](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1081)
- Update opcodes along HF switches, added a dedicated `tangerineWhistle` opcode list (no need for calls to `VM._updateOpcodes()` on HF switches manually any more), PR [#1101](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1101) and [#1112](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1112)
- Use `common` from VM when creating default blocks in `VM.runCall()` and `VM.runCode()`, PR [#1011](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1011)
- Fixed a bug when the result of the `MODEXP` opcode is 0, PR [#1026](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1026)

### Maintenance

- Updated `run-solidity-contract` example, PR [#1104](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1104)
- Updated `ethereum/tests` submodule to `1fcd4e5` (2021-02-02), PR [#1116](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1116)
- Only expose API method on docs, PR [#1119](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1119)

## 5.0.0 - 2020-11-24

### New Package Name

**Attention!** This new version is part of a series of EthereumJS releases all moving to a new scoped package name format. In this case the library is renamed as follows:

- `ethereumjs-vm` -> `@ethereumjs/vm`

Please update your library references accordingly or install with:

```shell
npm i @ethereumjs/vm
```

### Support for all current Hardforks / HF API Changes

This is the first release of the VM which supports all hardforks currently applied on mainnet starting with the support of the Frontier HF rules all along up to MuirGlacier. 🎉

The following HFs have been added:

- **Spurious Dragon**, PR [#791](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/791)
- **Tangerine Whistle**, PR [#807](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/807)
- **DAO**, PR [#843](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/843)
- **Homestead**, PR [#815](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/815)
- **Frontier**, PR [#828](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/828)

A VM with the specific HF rules (on the chain provided) can be instantiated by passing in a `Common` instance:

```typescript
import VM from '@ethereumjs/vm'
import Common from '@ethereumjs/common'

const common = new Common({ chain: 'mainnet', hardfork: 'spuriousDragon' })
const vm = new VM({ common })
```

**Breaking**: The default HF from the VM has been updated from `petersburg` to `istanbul`. The HF setting is now automatically taken from the HF set for `Common.DEAULT_HARDFORK`, see PR [#906](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/906).

**Breaking**: Please note that the options to directly pass in `chain` and `hardfork` strings have been removed to simplify the API. Providing a `Common` instance is now the only way to change the chain setup, see PR [#863](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/863)

### Berlin HF Support / HF-independent EIPs

This releases adds support for subroutines (`EIP-2315`) which gets activated under the `berlin` HF setting which can now be used as a `hardfork` instantiation option, see PR [#754](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/754).

**Attention!** Berlin HF support is still considered experimental and implementations can change on non-major VM releases!

Support for BLS12-381 precompiles (`EIP-2537`) is added as an independent EIP implementation - see PR [#785](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/785) - since there is still an ongoing discussion on taking this EIP in for Berlin or using a more generalized approach on curve computation with the Ethereum EVM (`evm384` by the eWASM team).

Another new EIP added is the `EIP-2929` with gas cost increases for state access opcodes, see PR [#889](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/889).

These integrations come along with an API addition to the VM to support the activation of specific EIPs, see PR [#856](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/856), PR [#869](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/869) and PR [#872](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/872).

This API can be used as follows:

```typescript
import Common from '@ethereumjs/common'
import VM from '@ethereumjs/vm'

const common = new Common({ chain: 'mainnet', eips: [2537] })
const vm = new VM({ common })
```

### API Change: New Major Library Versions

The following `EthereumJS` libraries which are used within the VM internally and can be passed in on instantiation have been updated to new major versions.

- `merkle-patricia-tree` `v3` (VM option `state`) -> `merkle-patricia-tree` `v4`, PR [#787](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/787)
- `ethereumjs-blockchain` `v4`-> `@ethereumjs/blockchain` `v5`, PR [#833](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/833)
- `ethereumjs-common` `v1` -> `@ethereumjs/common` `v2`

**Breaking**: If you pass in instances of these libraries to the VM please make sure to update these library versions as stated. Please also take a note on the package name changes!

All these libraries are now written in `TypeScript` and use promises instead of callbacks for accessing their APIs.

### New StateManager Interface / StateManager API Changes

There is now a new `TypeScript` interface for the `StateManager`, see PR [#763](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/763). If you are
using a custom `StateManager` you can use this interface to get better assurance that you are using a `StateManager` which conforms with the current `StateManager` API and will run in the VM without problems.

The integration of this new interface is highly encouraged since this release also comes with `StateManager` API changes. Usage of the old
[ethereumjs-account](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-account) package (this package will be retired) has been replaced by the new
[Account class](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-util/blob/master/docs/modules/_account_.md) from the `ethereumjs-util` package. This affects all `Account` related `StateManager` methods, see PR [#911](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/911).

The Util package also introduces a new [Address class](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-util/blob/master/docs/modules/_address_.md). This class replaces all current `Buffer` inputs on `StateManager` methods representing an address.

### Dual ES5 and ES2017 Builds

We significantly updated our internal tool and CI setup along the work on PR [#913](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/913) with an update to `ESLint` from `TSLint` for code linting and formatting and the introduction of a new build setup.

Packages now target `ES2017` for Node.js builds (the `main` entrypoint from `package.json`) and introduce a separate `ES5` build distributed along using the `browser` directive as an entrypoint, see PR [#921](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/921). This will result in performance benefits for Node.js consumers, see [here](https://github.com/ethereumjs/merkle-patricia-tree/pull/117) for a releated discussion.

### Support for all current Hardforks / HF API Changes

This is the first release of the VM which supports all hardforks
currently applied on mainnet starting with the support of the
Frontier HF rules all along up to MuirGlacier. 🎉

The following HFs have been added:

- **Spurious Dragon**,
  PR [#791](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/791)
- **Tangerine Whistle**,
  PR [#807](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/807)

A VM with the specific HF rules (on the chain provided) can be instantiated
by passing in a `Common` instance:

```typescript

import Common from '@ethereumjs/common'

const common = new Common({ chain: 'mainnet', hardfork: 'spuriousDragon' })

```

**Breaking**: The default HF from the VM has been updated from `petersburg` to `istanbul`.
The HF setting is now automatically taken from the HF set for `Common.DEAULT_HARDFORK`,
see PR [#906](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/906).

**Breaking**: Please note that the options to directly pass in
`chain` and `hardfork` strings have been removed to simplify the API.
Providing a `Common` instance is now the only way to change
the chain setup, see PR [#863](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/863)

### Berlin HF Support / HF-independent EIPs

This releases adds support for subroutines (`EIP-2315`) which gets
activated under the `berlin` HF setting which can now be used
as a `hardfork` instantiation option, see
PR [#754](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/754).

**Attention!** Berlin HF support is still considered experimental
and implementations can change on non-major VM releases!

Support for BLS12-381 precompiles (`EIP-2537`) is added as an independent EIP
implementation - see PR [#785](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/785) -
since there is still an ongoing discussion on taking this EIP in for Berlin or
using a more generalized approach on curve computation with the Ethereum EVM
(`evm384` by the eWASM team).

Another new EIP added is the `EIP-2929` with gas cost increases for state access
opcodes, see PR [#889](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/889).

These integrations come along with an API addition to the VM to support the activation
of specific EIPs, see PR [#856](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/856),
PR [#869](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/869) and
PR [#872](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/872).

This API can be used as follows:

```typescript
import Common from '@ethereumjs/common'
import VM from '@ethereumjs/vm'

const common = new Common({ chain: 'mainnet', eips: [2537] })
const vm = new VM({ common })
```

### API Change: New Major Library Versions

The following `EthereumJS` libraries which are used within the VM internally
and can be passed in on instantiation have been updated to new major versions.

- `merkle-patricia-tree` `v3` (VM option `state`) -> `merkle-patricia-tree` `v4`,
  PR [#787](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/787)
- `ethereumjs-blockchain` `v4`-> `@ethereumjs/blockchain` `v5`,
  PR [#833](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/833)
- `ethereumjs-common` `v1` -> `@ethereumjs/common` `v2`

**Breaking**: If you pass in instances of these libraries to the VM please make sure to
update these library versions as stated. Please also take a note on the
package name changes!

All these libraries are now written in `TypeScript` and use promises instead of
callbacks for accessing their APIs.

### New StateManager Interface / StateManager API Changes

There is now a new `TypeScript` interface for the `StateManager`, see
PR [#763](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/763). If you are
using a custom `StateManager` you can use this interface to get better
assurance that you are using a `StateManager` which conforms with the current
`StateManager` API and will run in the VM without problems.

The integration of this new interface is highly encouraged since this release
also comes with `StateManager` API changes. Usage of the old
[ethereumjs-account](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-account) package
(this package will be retired) has been replaced by the new
[Account class](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-util/blob/master/docs/modules/_account_.md)
from the `ethereumjs-util` package. This affects all `Account` related
`StateManager` methods, see PR [#911](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/911).

The Util package also introduces a new
[Address class](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-util/blob/master/docs/modules/_address_.md).
This class replaces all current `Buffer` inputs on `StateManager` methods representing an address.

### Dual ES5 and ES2017 Builds

We significantly updated our internal tool and CI setup along the work on
PR [#913](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/913) with an update to `ESLint` from `TSLint`
for code linting and formatting and the introduction of a new build setup.

Packages now target `ES2017` for Node.js builds (the `main` entrypoint from `package.json`) and introduce
a separate `ES5` build distributed along using the `browser` directive as an entrypoint, see
PR [#921](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/921). This will result
in performance benefits for Node.js consumers, see [here](https://github.com/ethereumjs/merkle-patricia-tree/pull/117) for a releated discussion.

## [4.1.1] - 2019-11-19

First stable `Istanbul` release passing all `StateTests` and `BlockchainTests`
from the official Ethereum test suite
[v7.0.0-beta.1](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/releases/tag/v7.0.0-beta.1).
Test suite conformance have been reached along work on
PR [#607](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/607) (thanks @s1na!)
and there were several fixes along the way, so it is strongly recommended that
you upgrade from the first `beta` `Istanbul` release `v4.1.0`.

**Istanbul Related Fixes**

- Refund counter has been moved from the `EEI` to the `EVM` module,
  PR [#612](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/612), `gasRefund`
  is re-added to the `execResult` in the `EVM` module at the end of message
  execution in `EVM` to remain (for the most part) backwards-compatible in the
  release
- Fixed `blake2f` precompile for rounds > `0x4000000`
- Fixed issues causing `RevertPrecompiled*` test failures
- Fixed an issue where the `RIPEMD` precompile has to remain _touched_ even
  when the call reverts and be considered for deletion,
  see [EIP issue #716](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/716) for context
- Updated `ethereumjs-block` to `v2.2.1`
- Updated `ethereumjs-blockchain` to `v4.0.2`
- Limited `ethereumjs-util` from `^6.1.0` to `~6.1.0`
- Hardfork-related fixes in test runners and test utilities

- Improved event documentation,
  PR [#601](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/601)

[4.1.1]: https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/compare/%40ethereumjs%2Fvm%404.1.0...%40ethereumjs%2Fvm%404.1.1

## [4.1.0] - 2019-09-12

This is the first feature-complete `Istanbul` release, containing implementations
for all 6 EIPs, see the HF meta EIP [EIP-1679](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1679)
for an overview. Beside this release contains further unrelated features as
well as bug fixes.

Note that `Istanbul` support is still labeled as `beta`. All implementations
have only basic test coverage since the official Ethereum consensus tests are
not yet merged. There might be also last minute changes to EIPs during the
testing period.

**Istanbul Summary**

See the VM `Istanbul` hardfork meta issue
[#501](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/issues/501) for a summary

[4.1.0]: https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/compare/%40ethereumjs%2Fvm%404.0.0...%40ethereumjs%2Fvm%404.1.0

## [4.0.0] - 2019-08-06

First `TypeScript` based VM release, other highlights:

- New Call and Code Loop Structure / EVM Encapsulation
- EEI for Environment Communication
- Istanbul Process Start
- Promise-based API

See [v4.0.0-beta.1](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/releases/tag/v4.0.0-beta.1)
release for full release notes.

**Changes since last beta**

- Simplification of execution results,
  PR [#551](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/551)
- Fix error propagation in `Cache.flush()` method from `StateManager`,

[4.0.0]: https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/compare/%40ethereumjs%2Fvm%404.0.0...%40ethereumjs%2Fta.1...v4.0.0

## [4.0.0-beta.1] - 2019-06-19

Since changes in this release are pretty deep reaching and broadly distributed,
we will first drop out one or several `beta` releases until we are confident on
both external API as well as inner structural changes. See
[v4 branch](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/479) for some
major entry point into the work on the release.

It is highly recommended that you do some testing of your library against this
and following `beta` versions and give us some feedback!

These will be the main release notes for the `v4` feature updates, subsequent
`beta` releases and the final release will just publish the delta changes and
point here for reference.

Breaking changes in the release notes are preeceeded with `[BREAKING]`, do a
search for an overview.

The outstanding work of [@s1na](https://github.com/s1na) has to be mentioned
here. He has done the very large portion of the coding and without him this
release wouldn't have been possible. Thanks Sina! 🙂

So what's new?

### TypeScript

This is the first `TypeScript` release of the VM (yay! 🎉).

`TypeScript` handles `ES6` transpilation
[a bit differently](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/2719) (at the
end: cleaner) than `babel` so `require` syntax of the library slightly changes to:

```javascript
const VM = require('ethereumjs-monorepo').default
```

The library now also comes with **type declaration files** distributed along
with the package published.

### EVM Modularization and Structural Refactoring

##### New Call and Code Loop Structure / EVM Encapsulation

This release switches to a new class based and promisified structure for
working down VM calls and running through code loops, and encapsulates this
logic to be bound to the specific `EVM` (so the classical Ethereum Virtual Machine)
implementation in the
[evm](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/tree/master/src/evm) module,
opening the way for a future parallel `eWASM` additional implementation.

This new logic is mainly handled by the two new classes `EVM` (old: `Interpreter`)
and `Interpreter` (old: `Loop`),
see PR [#483](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/483)
for the initial work on this. The old `VM.runCall()` and `VM.runCode()`
methods are just kept as being wrappers and will likely be deprecated on future
releases once the inner API structure further stabilizes.

This new structure should make extending the VM by subclassing and
adopting functionality much easier, e.g. by changing opcode functionality or adding
custom onces by using an own `Interpreter.getOpHandler()` implementation. You are
highly encouraged to play around, see what you can do and give us feedback on
possibilities and limitations.

#### EEI for Environment Communication

For interacting with the blockchain environment there has been introduced a
dedicated `EEI` (Ethereum Environment Interface) module closely resembling the
respective
[EEI spec](https://github.com/ewasm/design/blob/master/eth_interface.md), see
PR [#486](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/486) for the initial
work.

This makes handling of environmental data by the VM a lot cleaner and transparent
and should as well allow for much easier extension and modification.

##### Changes

- Detached precompiles from the VM,
  PR [#492](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/492)
- Subdivided `runState`, refactored `Interpreter` (old: `Loop`),
  PR [#498](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/498)
- [BREAKING] Dropped `emitFreeLogs` flag, to replace it is suggested to
  implement by inheriting `Interpreter` (old: `Loop`),
  PR [#498](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/498)
- Split `EVM.executeMessage()` with `EVM.executeCall()` and
  `EVM.executeCreate()` for `call` and `create` specific logic
  (old names: `Interpreter.[METHOD_NAME]()`),
  PR [#499](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/499)
- Further simplification of `Interpreter`/`EVM`
  (old: `Loop`/`Interpreter`) structure,
  PR [#506](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/506)
- [BREAKING] Dropped `VM.runJit()` in favor of direct handling in
  `EVM` (old: `Interpreter`),
  officially not part of the external API but mentioning just in case,
  PR [#515](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/515)
- Removed `StorageReader`, moved logic to `StateManager`,
  [#534](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/534)

### Istanbul Process Start

With this release we start the `Istanbul` hardfork integration process and
have activated the `istanbul` `hardfork` option for the constructor.

This is meant to be used experimentation and reference implementations, we have made
a start with integrating draft [EIP-1108](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1108)
`Istanbul` candidate support reducing the gas costs for `alt_bn128` precompiles,
see PR [#539](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/issues/539) for
implementation details.

Note that this is still very early in the process since no EIP in a final
state is actually accepted for being included into `Istanbul` on the time of
release. The `v4` release series will be kept as an experimental series
during the process with breaking changes introduced along the way without too
much notice, so be careful and tighten the VM dependency if you want to give
your users the chance for some early experimentation with some specific
implementation state.

Once scope of `Istanbul` as well as associated EIPs are finalized a stable
`Istanbul` VM version will be released as a subsequent major release.

### Code Modernization and Version Updates

The main API with the `v4` release switches from being `callback` based to
using promises,
see PR [#546](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/546).

Here is an example for changed API call `runTx`.

Old `callback`-style invocation:

```javascript
vm.runTx(
  {
    tx: tx,
  },
  function (err, result) {
    if (err) {
      // Handle errors appropriately
    }
    // Do something with the result
  }
)
```

Promisified usage:

```javascript
try {
  let result = await vm.runTx({ tx: tx })
  // Do something with the result
} catch (err) {
  // handle errors appropriately
}
```

[4.0.0-beta.1]: https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/compare/%40ethereumjs%2Fvm%403.0.0...%40ethereumjs%2Fvm%404.0.0-beta.1

## [3.0.0] - 2019-03-29

This release comes with a modernized `ES6`-class structured code base, some
significant local refactoring work regarding how `Stack` and `Memory`
are organized within the VM and it finalizes a first round of module structuring
now having separate folders for `bloom`, `evm` and `state` related code. The
release also removes some rarely used parts of the API (`hookedVM`, `VM.deps`).

All this is to a large extend preparatory work for a `v4.0.0` release which will
follow in the next months with `TypeScript` support and more system-wide
refactoring work leading to a more modular and expandable VM and providing the
ground for future `eWASM` integration. If you are interested in the release
process and want to take part in the refactoring discussion see the associated
issue [#455](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/issues/455).

[3.0.0]: https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/compare/%40ethereumjs%2Fvm%402.6.0...%40ethereumjs%2Fvm%403.0.0

## [2.6.0] - 2019-02-07

**Petersburg Support**

Support for the `Petersburg` (aka `constantinopleFix`) hardfork by integrating
`Petersburg` ready versions of associated libraries, see also
PR [#433](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/433):

- `ethereumjs-common` (chain and HF logic and helper functionality) [v1.1.0](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-common/releases/tag/v1.1.0)
- `ethereumjs-blockchain` [v3.4.0](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-blockchain/releases/tag/v3.4.0)
- `ethereumjs-block` [v2.2.0](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-block/releases)

To instantiate the VM with `Petersburg` HF rules set the `opts.hardfork`
constructor parameter to `petersburg`. This will run the VM on the new
Petersburg rules having removed the support for
[EIP 1283](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1283).

**Goerli Readiness**

The VM is now also ready to execute on blocks from the final version of the
[Goerli](https://github.com/goerli/testnet) cross-client testnet and can
therefore be instantiated with `opts.chain` set to `goerli`.

**Bug Fixes**

- Fixed mixed `sync`/`async` functions in `cache`,
  PR [#422](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/422)
- Fixed a bug in `setStateroot` and caching by clearing the `stateManager` cache
  after setting the state root such that stale values are not returned,
  PR [#420](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/420)
- Fixed cache access on the hooked VM (_deprecated_),
  PR [#434](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/434)

**Refactoring**

Following changes might be relevant for you if you are hotfixing/monkey-patching
on parts of the VM:

- Moved `bloom` to its own directory,
  PR [#429](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/429)
- Moved `opcodes`, `opFns` and `logTable` to `lib/vm`,
  PR [#425](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/425)
- Converted `Bloom` to `ES6` class,
  PR [#428](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/428)
- Converted `Cache` to `ES6` class, added unit tests,
  PR [427](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/427)

[2.6.0]: https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/compare/%40ethereumjs%2Fvm%402.5.1...%40ethereumjs%2Fvm%402.6.0

  PR [#402](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/402)

[2.5.1]: https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/compare/%40ethereumjs%2Fvm%402.5.0...%40ethereumjs%2Fvm%402.5.1

## [2.5.0] - 2018-11-21

This is the first release of the VM with full support for all `Constantinople` EIPs. It further comes along with huge improvements on consensus conformity and introduces the `Beta` version of a new `StateManager` API.

### Constantinople Support

For running the VM with `Constantinople` hardfork rules, set the [option](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/blob/master/docs/index.md#vm) in the `VM` constructor `opts.hardfork` to `constantinople`. Supported hardforks are `byzantium` and `constantinople`, `default` setting will stay on `byzantium` for now but this will change in a future release.

Changes related to Constantinople:

- EIP 1283 `SSTORE`, see PR [#367](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/367)
- EIP 1014 `CREATE2`, see PR [#329](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/329)
- EIP 1052 `EXTCODEHASH`, see PR [#324](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/324)
- Constantinople ready versions of [ethereumjs-block](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-block/releases/tag/v2.1.0) and [ethereumjs-blockchain](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-blockchain/releases/tag/v3.3.0) dependencies (difficulty bomb delay), see PRs [#371](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/371), [#325](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/325)

### Consensus Conformity

This release is making a huge leap forward regarding consensus conformity, and even if you are not interested in `Constantinople` support at all, you should upgrade just for this reason. Some context: we couldn't run blockchain tests for a long time on a steady basis due to performance constraints and when we re-triggered a test run after quite some time with PR [#341](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/341) the result was a bit depressing with over 300 failing tests. Thanks to joined efforts from the community and core team members we could bring this down far quicker than expected and this is the first release for a long time which practically comes with complete consensus conformity - with just three recently added tests failing (see `skipBroken` list in `test/tester.js`) and otherwise passing all blockchain tests and all state tests for both `Constantinople` and `Byzantium` rules. 🏆 🏆 🏆

Consensus Conformity related changes:

- Reset `selfdestruct` on `REVERT`, see PR [#392](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/392)
- Undo `Bloom` filter changes from PR [#295](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/295), see PR [#384](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/384)
- Fixes broken `BLOCKHASH` opcode, see PR [#381](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/381)
- Fix failing blockchain test `GasLimitHigherThan2p63m1`, see PR [#380](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/380)
- Stop adding `account` to `cache` when checking if it is empty, see PR [#375](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/375)

### State Manager Interface

The `StateManager` (`lib/stateManager.js`) - providing a high-level interface to account and contract data from the underlying state trie structure - has been completely reworked and there is now a close-to-being finalized API (currently marked as `Beta`) coming with its own [documentation](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/blob/master/docs/stateManager.md).

This comes along with larger refactoring work throughout more-or-less the whole code base and the `StateManager` now completely encapsulates the trie structure and the cache backend used, see issue [#268](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/issues/268) and associated PRs for reference. This will make it much easier in the future to bring along an own state manager serving special needs (optimized for memory and performance, run on mobile,...) by e.g. using a different trie implementation, cache or underlying storage or database backend.

We plan to completely separate the currently still integrated state manager into its own repository in one of the next releases, this will then be a breaking `v3.0.0` release. Discussion around a finalized interface (we might e.g. drop all genesis-releated methods respectively methods implemented in the `DefaultStateManager`) is still ongoing and you are very much invited to jump in and articulate your needs, just take e.g. the issue mentioned above as an entry point.

Change related to the new `StateManager` interface:

- `StateManager` interface simplification, see PR [#388](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/388)
- Make `StateManager` cache and trie private, see PR [#385](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/385)
- Remove vm accesses to `StateManager` `trie` and `cache`, see PR [#376](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/376)
- Remove explicit direct cache interactions, see PR [#366](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/366)
- Remove contract specific commit, see PR [#335](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/335)
- Fixed incorrect references to `trie` in tests, see PR [#345](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/345)
- Added `StateManager` API documentation, see PR [#393](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/393)

### New Features

- New `emitFreeLogs` option, allowing any contract to emit an unlimited quantity of events without modifying the block gas limit (default: `false`) which can be used in debugging contexts, see PRs [#378](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/378), [#379](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/379)

### Testing and Documentation

Beyond the reintegrated blockchain tests there is now a separate test suite to test the API of the library, see `test/api`. This should largely reduce the risk of introducing new bugs on the API level on future changes, generally ease the development process by being able to develop against the specific tests and also allows using the tests as a reference for examples on how to use the API.

On the documentation side the API documentation has also been consolidated and there is now a unified and auto-generated [API documentation](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/blob/master/docs/index.md) (previously being manually edited (and too often forgotten) in `README`).

- Added API tests for `index.js`, `StateManager`, see PR [#364](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/364)
- Added API Tests for `runJit` and `fakeBlockchain`, see PR [#331](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/331)

- Added `runTx` API tests, see PR [#352](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/352)
- Added API Tests for the `Bloom` module, see PR [#330](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/330)
- New consistent auto-generated [API documentation](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/blob/master/docs/index.md), see PR [#377](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/377)
- Blockchain tests now run by default on CI, see PR [#374](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/374)
- Switched from `istanbul` to `nyc`, see PR [#334](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/334)
- Usage of `sealEngine` in blockchain tests, see PR [#373](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/373)
- New `tap-spec` option to get a formatted test run result summary, see [README](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo#running-tests-with-a-reporterformatter), see PR [#363](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/363)
- Updates/fixes on the JSDoc comments, see PRs [#362](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/362), [#361](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/361)

[2.5.0]: https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/compare/%40ethereumjs%2Fvm%402.4.0...%40ethereumjs%2Fvm%402.5.0

## [2.4.0] - 2018-07-27

With the `2.4.x` release series we now start to gradually add `Constantinople` features with the
bitwise shifting instructions from [EIP 145](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-145)
making the start being introduced in the `v2.4.0` release.

Since both the scope of the `Constantinople` hardfork as well as the state of at least some of the EIPs
to be included are not yet finalized, this is only meant for `EXPERIMENTAL` purposes, e.g. for developer
tools to give users early access and make themself familiar with dedicated features.

Once scope and EIPs from `Constantinople` are final we will target a `v2.5.0` release which will officially
introduce `Constantinople` support with all the changes bundled together.

Note that from this release on we also introduce new `chain` (default: `mainnet`) and `hardfork`
(default: `byzantium`) initialization parameters, which make use of our new [ethereumjs-common](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-common) library and in the future will allow
for parallel hardfork support from `Byzantium` onwards.

Since `hardfork` default might be changed or dropped in future releases, you might want to explicitly
set this to `byzantium` on your next update to avoid future unexpected behavior.

All the changes from this release:

**FEATURES/FUNCTIONALITY**

- Improved chain and fork support, see PR [#304](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/304)
- Support for the `Constantinople` bitwise shifiting instructions `SHL`, `SHR` and `SAR`, see PR [#251](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/251)
- New `newContract` event which can be used to do interrupting tasks on contract/address creation, see PR [#306](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/306)
- Alignment of behavior of bloom filter hashing to go along with mainnet compatible clients _BREAKING_, see PR [#295](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/295)

**UPDATES/TESTING**

- Usage of the latest `rustbn.js` API, see PR [#312](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/312)
- Some cleanup in precompile error handling, see PR [#318](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/318)
- Some cleanup for `StateManager`, see PR [#266](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/266)
- Renaming of `util.sha3` usages to `util.keccak256` and bump `ethereumjs-util` to `v5.2.0` (you should do to if you use `ethereumjs-util`)
- Parallel testing of the`Byzantium` and `Constantinople` state tests, see PR [#317](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/317)
- For lower build times our CI configuration now runs solely on `CircleCI` and support for `Travis` have been dropped, see PR [#316](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/316)

**BUG FIXES**

- Programmatic runtime errors in the VM execution context (within an opcode) are no longer absorbed and displayed as a VMError but explicitly thrown, allowing for easier discovery of implementation bugs, see PR [#307](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/307)
- Fix of the `Bloom.check()` method not working properly, see PR [#311](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/311)
